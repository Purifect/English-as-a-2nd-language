    "- Each link should be to a web page that has only one user review of only one movie, e.g., the user review permalinks on the IMDB site.\n",
    "- Choose reviews of movies that are all in the same genre, e.g., sci-fi, mystery, romance, superhero, etc.  \n",
    "- Make sure your collection includes reviews of several movies in your chosen genre and that it includes a mix of negative and positive reviews.  \n"
