0,Avengers: Endgame,Not as good as infinity war..,"But its a pretty good film. A bit of a mess in some parts, lacking the cohesive and effortless feel infinity war somehow managed to accomplish. Some silly plot holes and characters that could've been cut (Ahem, captain marvel and thanos). The use of Captain marvel in this film was just ridiculous. Shes there at the start, bails for some reason? And then pops up at the end to serve no purpose but deux ex machina a space ship...The past thanos part wasn't necessary when you think about it, they could've done this film without a real 'villain' And it would've worked and been a original take on a super hero film without using the same formula we have seen in 10+ super hero films already. The entire final battle felt like a rehashed messy battle, with a bunch more characters against thanos - basically mixing the space battle from infinity war; iron man, spider man etc and the final battle of infinity war with captain america, thor etc.. mashing those two into one within this new film. The scenes of trying to pull the gauntlet off his hand.. it all felt like a rehash.To me the best part of the film was the first act and half of the second, when everyone is lost and trying to figure out how to continue on. really interesting themes that followed the pay off from infinity wars ending. And then the time heist part. Tho the heist part should've been much more stretched out. With only small parts of thanos within that, and not having him be the big bad again. But just a side character that gets in the way a little bit.And the setting up for 'new avengers' to replace the beloved actors and characters we have come to associate with these films.. they do not get me at all excited for the next phase in marvel films. Falcon, Valkyrie, blackpanther, cap marvel? I just dont care about them at all. And their actors lack any charisma or depth.To me this feels like a closing of marvel films that I'll really enjoy for my pop corn fix. I've given infinity war a 10/10 and some of the stand alone films 8's and 9's. But I have a sinking feeling this will not be happening in the future except the guardians of the galaxy films.It seems i maybe in the minority for my feelings towards this film, but im not sugar coating my opinion like it seems a few people are doing due to nostalgia. Its good, but not great. Had the opportunity to be better, maybe? And the setting up of new characters to come possible reflects on my score to... Because i just don't give two cents about any of them","[['good film'], ['A bit', 'a mess', 'effortless feel', 'infinity', 'war'], ['Some silly plot', 'Ahem', 'marvel', 'thanos'], ['The use', 'Captain', 'marvel', 'this film'], ['the start', 'some reason'], ['the end', 'no purpose', 'deux ex', 'a space', 'ship', 'The past thanos part', 'this film', ""a real 'villain"", 'a original take', 'a super hero', 'film', 'the same formula', 'super hero'], ['The entire final battle', 'a rehashed messy battle', 'a bunch', 'the space', 'battle', 'infinity war', 'iron', 'man', 'man', 'etc', 'the final battle', 'infinity', 'war', 'captain', 'america', 'thor', 'this new film'], ['the gauntlet', 'hand', 'a rehash.To', 'part', 'the film', 'the first act', 'half', 'everyone'], ['the pay', 'infinity'], ['the time', 'heist part'], ['the heist part'], [], ['a side', 'character', 'the way', 'a little bit.And', 'the next phase', 'marvel'], ['Falcon', 'Valkyrie', 'cap', 'marvel'], ['care'], ['any charisma', 'a closing', 'marvel', 'pop', 'corn', 'fix'], ['infinity', 'war', 'the stand'], ['a sinking', 'feeling', 'the future', 'the galaxy', 'films.It', 'the minority', 'this film', 'opinion'], [], ['the opportunity'], ['score', 'i']]","[['good film'], ['bit', 'mess', 'parts', 'feel infinity war'], ['plot holes', 'characters', 'Ahem', 'marvel and thanos'], ['use of Captain marvel', 'film'], ['Shes', 'start', 'bails', 'reason'], ['end', 'purpose', 'deux ex', 'space ship', 'past thanos part', 'film', ""real 'villain"", 'original take', 'hero film', 'same formula', 'hero films'], ['entire final battle', 'rehashed messy battle', 'bunch', 'characters', 'space battle', 'infinity war', 'iron man', 'man etc', 'battle of infinity war', 'captain america', 'thor', 'new film'], ['scenes', 'gauntlet', 'hand', 'rehash.To', 'part', 'film', 'first act and half', 'everyone'], ['interesting themes', 'pay', 'infinity wars'], ['time', 'heist part'], ['heist part'], ['parts of thanos'], ['side character', 'way', 'little bit.And', ""'new avengers"", 'beloved actors and characters', 'films', 'phase in marvel films'], ['Falcon', 'Valkyrie', 'cap marvel'], ['care'], ['actors', 'charisma', 'feels', 'closing of marvel films', 'pop corn fix'], ['infinity war', 'stand'], ['sinking feeling', 'future', 'guardians', 'galaxy films.It', 'minority', 'feelings', 'film', 'opinion', 'few people'], [], ['opportunity'], ['new characters', 'score', 'i', 'cents']]"
1,Avengers: Endgame,Crazy in every sense,"This film is an emotional rollercoaster with some of the coolest superhero plot lines ever drawn up. It's straight up the most epic Marvel film that will probably ever be created. I don't see how Marvel could ever top this, but getting to see these characters all together at least one last time was a reward all on its own.","[['This film', 'an emotional rollercoaster', 'superhero', 'plot'], ['Marvel', 'film'], ['Marvel', 'last time', 'a reward']]","[['film', 'emotional rollercoaster', 'superhero plot lines'], ['Marvel film'], ['Marvel', 'characters', 'last time', 'reward']]"
2,Avengers: Endgame,Not as good as infinity war but a great movie,"Rating: 8.6Not as good as Infinity war pacing-wise, but is a satisfying ending to the saga. High production quality, and a great soundtrack like its predecessor. The final fight did feel a little cliché (two armies brainlessly charging at each other for a typical smackdown). Not much to write about, it made every marvel movie before it worth the ticket.","[['Infinity', 'war', 'pacing-wise', 'the saga'], ['High production', 'quality', 'a great soundtrack', 'predecessor'], ['The final fight', 'a little cliché', 'a typical smackdown'], ['every marvel', 'movie', 'the ticket']]","[['Infinity war pacing-wise', 'saga'], ['production quality', 'great soundtrack', 'predecessor'], ['final fight', 'little cliché', 'armies', 'typical smackdown'], ['marvel movie', 'ticket']]"
3,Avengers: Endgame,Time travel is such a lazy way to write stories,"Only a month or so back I was talking to a friend about how much I hate it when serious movies use time travel to get their characters out of problems. I have no problem with movies like 'Back to the Future' or 'Hot Tub Time Machine' that are both comedy based and use the time machine as a plot for the movie as opposed to a solution for characters problems. When a serious movie uses it though it as lazy as writing as dream sequence in my opinion.At the end of the day though that just underlines the problem with these movies. The heroes are far too powerful. Whatever power they need they simply possess conveniently. Heck, 'Dr Strange' can even see into the future to know exactly what to do to make sure everything turns out alright. If that isn't the stupidest thing I've ever seen in a movie I don't know what is.I felt like the movie went very much as expected as well. Sure some characters die, however they were pretty much telegraphed to do so long before the movie came out. There also seemed to be a lack of conflict as key moments. A lot of things went far too smoothly for my liking in terms of the plan. Finally, the ending with 'Iron Man' simply pulling the glove off 'Thanos' - what the hell was that? Was that supposed to be clever writing? 'Thanos' just standing there for an eternity doing nothing waiting for someone to stop him?A lot of the jokes failed to land too. This was a surprisingly unfunny movie. In a 3 hour movie I got maybe 3 light chuckles out of the film. Every joke just felt so forced and some of the characters who don't have a comedy background delivered them very poorly. 'Avengers: Endgame' is three hours of my life I would like back.","[['a month', 'a friend', 'time', 'travel'], ['no problem', ""'Back"", 'Future', 'Time Machine', 'both comedy', 'the time', 'machine', 'a plot', 'the movie', 'a solution'], ['a serious movie', 'writing', 'dream', 'sequence', 'opinion.At', 'the end', 'the day', 'the problem'], [], ['power'], ['Heck', 'Strange', 'the future', 'sure everything', 'alright'], ['thing', 'a movie', 'felt', 'the movie'], ['the movie'], ['a lack', 'conflict'], ['A lot', 'liking', 'the plan'], [""'Iron Man"", 'the glove', 'the hell'], ['Was', 'clever writing'], ['an eternity', 'nothing', 'someone', 'A lot'], ['unfunny movie'], ['hour', 'movie', 'the film'], ['Every joke', 'a comedy', 'background'], ['Endgame', 'life']]","[['month', 'friend', 'serious movies', 'time travel', 'characters out of problems'], ['problem with movies', ""'Back"", 'Future', 'Time Machine', 'comedy', 'time machine', 'plot', 'movie', 'solution for characters problems'], ['serious movie', 'writing as dream sequence', 'opinion.At', 'end', 'day', 'problem', 'movies'], ['heroes'], ['power'], ['Heck', 'Strange', 'future', 'sure everything', 'alright'], ['thing', 'movie', 'felt', 'movie'], ['characters', 'movie'], ['lack of conflict', 'key moments'], ['lot of things', 'liking in terms', 'plan'], [""'Iron Man"", ""glove off 'Thanos"", 'hell'], ['Was', 'clever writing'], [""'Thanos"", 'eternity', 'nothing', 'someone', 'lot', 'jokes'], ['unfunny movie'], ['hour movie', 'light chuckles', 'film'], ['joke', 'characters', 'comedy background'], [""'Avengers"", 'Endgame', 'hours', 'life']]"
4,Avengers: Endgame,"The writers got carried away, the directors over reached and the studio sacrificed the integrity of their product.","I've just come from watching Endgame and I must say that I am disappointed.I loved Civil War and I loved Infinity War. When I came out of those films, I knew immediately that they were great and that I wanted to see them again. With Endgame, I'm not sure.I respect how they were prepared to show the consequences of what Thanos had done but by killing him off so quickly and then them having to do their own stone quest (hadn't we already seen Thanos doing this in IW) it felt slow and lazy. Worse still was that it felt very self-indulgent and attempting to be clever for clever sake.Like how Back to the Future II considered itself clever for showing the events of the first film but with Marty flitting around behind the scenes to ensure that it all still happened. I know it's meant to be fan pleasing but it really felt like a gimmick and lacking in confidence. Almost like it was saying 'Hey guys, this will make you smile'. If you want to make me smile, concentrate on maintaining the quality of your product rather than directly trying to make me like you.But the trouble with messing around with timelines and bouncing around is that it makes the audience start asking questions during the film. The linearity that we'd seen in IW and the imminent fast approaching threat is replaced in Endgame with a lack of direction and characters that are earlier versions of who the audience have seen.In IW we were shown Thanos. He was written to be sympathetic or at least a character that we the audience could understand. He believed in what he was doing and this made him more rounded. But in Endgame, that version is dispatched quickly and we are supplied with a 2014 (?) Thanos who isn't the character we know but is just a token bad guy.This Thanos hasn't made the sacrifice at Vormire, he isn't the guy that would empathise with Scarlet Witch for what she did to Vision. He has suddenly become a token cut out evil bad guy that needs to be defeated. Hell, the writers even manage to forget their own time loop by saying that this Thanos has learnt that he doesn't want to wipe out 50% anymore because they are too ungrateful. How does he know this when the 2014 Thanos has only just literally arrived in the post wipeout Universe? How has he had time to form the opinion that his previous quest for a 50% cull isn't worthy?Is this a case of the writers being terrified that they had created a bad guy that people related to or was it a fear that they'd written themselves into a hole? Why go to the effort of creating that character in IW to suddenly kill him off at the beginning of Endgame just for a dramatic punch?For me, the time travelling and stone gathering wasted time to create unimportant scenes that fundamentally undermine the films that came before.
In my opinion it would have been better if they had shown the remaining Avengers preparing to do some Avenging and maintained the single minded linearity of IW of battling towards and reaching a post click Thanos and somehow reversing his work.The more I think of the film, the more plot holes and frustrations manifest themselves. Thor's drinking and man child antics might have been initially funny but one begins to realise that they are deliberately doing this to clip his wings. Likewise with Hulk, his primordial desire to smash and destroy has been removed to think it out and he has become an embarrassing shadow of his former self.The thing that is meant to be amazing about the MCU is the world building but inconsistencies have been appearing and there are so many in Endgame that it makes you question whether these two films are written by the same people.In IW, Thanos is a dangerous and credible threat because he has the infinity stones. He takes on half of the Avengers, Strange and some of the Guardians on Titan and smashes them and then takes on the other half on Wakanda and smashes them. Yet it is Stormbreaker (whose creation we have seen been hard earned by a motivated Thor) that has the power to take down Thanos even when he has a full complement of Infinity Stones.Yet we roll forward to Endgame and we have literally all the good guys together in one place, Cap with his shield, Tony fully powered up, Scarlet Witch p*ssed and vengeful, Capt Marvel who can seemingly do anything and Thor wielding both Mjolnir AND Stormbreaker and Thanos NOT in possession of the gauntlet, yet they can't defeat him.It's like the fights in IW were so amazing because the good guys were taking on an unbeatable foe yet here he is now seemingly defeatable by the 'rules' that the writers established . A good example of this would be in IW when Cap is the last man standing before Scarlet Witch and he grabs the gauntlet. You see the look of admiration/respect on Thanos' face that Cap is holding open the gauntlet before he punches him to the ground yet now that scene seems pointless.The writers for Endgame seem to have been driven to undo everything they did in IW. All the tension, all the sacrifice, all the development of Thanos discarded for well, I don't know what. It makes no sense.IW had two incredible scenes that used to choke me up. When Cap appears in the train station, the Avengers theme kicks in and Falcon and Widow take down the henchman in a wonderfully choreographed scene. In just that one scene it shows them coming to the rescue, it shows how intuitively they work together and it showcases their heroism.Likewise when Thor creates Stormbreaker and makes his entrance on Wakanda, I felt it for the journey that Thor has been on. He's had to contend with loss and defeat and humiliation and this is his redemption. Here is a character that has earned his game changing weapon and when he arrives and demands to face a character that everyone else is running away from, I want to punch the air.But in Endgame, that feels like it has to be corrupted. We can't have Thor being dominant, let's break him and make him a fool. We can't have Thanos being complicated and relatable, let's make him a cut out bad guy. We can't have Hulk being rage fuelled and smashing stuff up, let's make him more sensitive and talking stuff out. We can't have Cap being stoic and heroic, let's have him ridiculing one of his own iconic lines in a silly gimmicky fight with himself and commenting on his butt. We can't have a powerful female character that we're invested in look sexy AND be able to take down Thanos, let's give Scarlet Witch a small part but focus our attention on a female character that hasn't earnt our admiration or desire for revenge.To be honest, the 'rules of engagement' had been set so well in IW that when in Endgame Thanos massed his ranks against the Avengers and then ALL of the good guys showed up, I was almost expecting the camera to pull away and not show the fight given that it was so obviously going to be an easy win for the good guys.And as for the big fight scene, it did reek of what DC always manage to do which is just throw everything into an end battle and bludgeon you with CGI and pyrotechnics so that you aren't really sure what is going on.In the many fights in IW, you knew what was going on, you recognised the combatants, you understood the stakes and you identified the geography of the scene. In Endgame we got one big massive fight where everything was thrown in the pot and it was just assumed by the directors that we would be happy with all the flashing lights.
And I have to say that considering that Steve and Tony fell out so hard, and that Tony's criticism of Steve was so unfair, that I really had hoped for more than just a handshake, a muttering of 'no worries' and 'here's your shield'. These guys wrote and directed Civil War, they created the line 'we fell out hard' and hence I had hoped for something deeper and more touching than a handshake.Steve wrote Tony a letter telling him that when he needed him he'd be there but once again the Iron Man bias had to creep in and once again Tony was the victim and the ultimate hero.But I think my biggest problem is how the convenient time travelling undermines everything. When a franchise starts retrofitting stuff (like Fury's eye being from a space cat), it's then hard to consider the previous stories.Having 2014 Gamorra means that all the evolution that we saw her go through in GOTG 1 and 2 is wasted. Having Cap marry Peggy means the pain of his sacrifice, him seeing her in Winter Soldier when she is suffering from Alzheimer's, hell even his blossoming relationship with Sharon Carter is kinda irrelevant. Having seen Thor at last step away from his two weaker origin films into the entertainment of Ragnarok and the redemption in IW leaves us now with a bumbling buffoon.We know that what makes Captain America what he is, is the serum that makes him a super soldier. That he was transformed from a weakling to a superhuman. Sam Wilson is not a super soldier and he didn't take the serum. He is Falcon. Now maybe in the comics he becomes Cap but Bucky is a super soldier. Is the new Cap going to foil an evil plot and be defeated with a tazer or a knife to the chest? Consider the beatings that Steve has taken and the physical strength that he has shown we can recognise that Sam Wilson does not have that.I'm sorry to say but the Russo's have dropped the ball. Themselves and their writers have succumbed to their success and their desire to be engineers of political correctness and social change. I thought Endgame would be the high soaring end to this 10 year run of impressive movie entertainment but in the end the writers got carried away, the directors over reached and the studio sacrificed the integrity of their product for a chance to 'educate' us all. A real shame and a wasted opportunity.Infinity War is clearly the highlight of the last 10 years but even now I fear that repeated viewings will render it pointless considering how the makers decided to fundamentally damage it.","[['Endgame', 'Civil War', 'Infinity War'], [], ['Endgame', 'Thanos', 'own stone', 'quest', 'Thanos', 'IW', 'lazy'], ['clever', 'clever', 'sake.Like', 'Future II',

6,Avengers: Endgame,Perfect ending,"After watching Infinity war, I was looking forward to much more this time, still a perfect ending.","[['Infinity', 'war', 'this time']]","[['Infinity war', 'time']]"
7,Avengers: Endgame,"A horribly, boring and goofy installment. Worst one yet.","This was a terrible film. I rented it and feel like I wasted my money. The movie is 3 hours long. 2 of those hours is just nonsense, comedy, and jabber. Then you get about thirty minutes of the big fight, followed by another thirty minutes of boredom. The male heroes are portrayed as buffoons, which is indicative of today's masculine-man-hating society. Based on today's man-hating culture, testosterone is evil. Women should be lumberjacks and Seal Team Six. Men should take estrogen pills and ask their wives to open the stuck peanut butter lid. I'm a proud sexist. I open doors for ladies. I also send my lady flowers just because, versus craftsman tools.This was one of the worst Avengers installments ever.

8,Avengers: Endgame,"downbeat, overblown & so so long. Cuts all your favourite characters down to size","Maybe I would have enjoyed this more if I were a real Marvel fanboy, although from reading the other reviews I might well have cause to doub that, but as someone coming to this film through all the hype, and the knowledge that this has just outgrossed Avatar in terms of the box office I am simply astonished how lacklustre this film is.Sometimes I dislike a film, and rail against it while secretly having quite enjoyed it, the objection being to some aspect of the film which annoyed me, maybe something ideological or political. But despite Marvel increasingly taking a political line on many things there is really very little in this film - at least on the surface - that one could find objectionable about it. In many ways in fact it is very routine and unobjectionable. But problem mainly relates to the film's obesity & overblown nature combined with a manufactured self-indulgence that was just annoying to watch.With respect to the latter this is mainly with reference to the final battle (where everyone who's anyone in the Marvel Universe makes an appearance) and the tying up of things in the post-coital glow: I get that this has been a long, epic and much loved journey for many film-goers, and also that fans will want a proper send-off etc for their favourites, but unfortunately this is done really badly, & inconceivably in an abrupt & unsatisfactory way, something that is hard to account for given the massive length of a movie that unfortunately in every other respect never ceased to feel slow and lumbering.In this regard we get some major goodbyes at the end with respect to characters who in this film at least we have seen for a matter of seconds. Essentially making any sense of this requires us to reference the history of these films, something which is simply bad & indulgent writing.The massive assembly of characters, particularly at the end, is supposed to be one of the pulls of the film, but instead it serves to make their appearance superficial and works to diminish them as individuals. Just imagine meeting your favourite Marvel comic book hero in real life: well, by the end of this film that actually sounds like a rather dull prospect: the overblown nature of the wrap-up diminishes everyone. Bringing them all together simply works to cancel out teir uniqueness & makes their fantastic and in their own right typically overblown powers (Captain Marvel especially) seem prosaic in juxtaposition with each other.But a bit of indulgence could be forgiven if the story was worth anything much. Unfortunately compared to Infinity, there's really very little to it. The time travel aspect to it was too referential with respect to other movies (self-referentiality hasn't really worked well since the Scream movies). Sometimes with these types of movies you get fans duking it out on account of whether an idea is plausible or not. Maybe that has been happening but if so I'd be surprised; the narrative device never seems to be taken particularly seriously & for that reason it's difficult for the audience to take it very seriously: the time travel aspect is simply what needs to happen in order to sort the situation out & the writers simply come up with necessary justificiation & a few quips to let us know that they know we've seen it all before a hundred times.A part of the problem here is that the character motivations while there on paper never really felt that real. Renner's character was perhaps the most convincing in describing the bleakness of the post-Infinity world, but it never really seemed quite enough. Half the universe wiped out - something worse than the Black Death or Mongol destruction at its worth - but it never seems like that big a deal. A tighter script, maybe focussed more on an aggrieved Renner or equivalent might have made it seem real & genuinely high stakes.Beyond that there was very little in the movie that was simply enjoyable, in the switch off your mind & enjoy the ride variety. Thor has already been emasculated - he is simply a fat slob, & for reasons presumably relating to the next Thor film - he never recovers except to discover some meaningless cliche about being himself instead of who he should be. Nebula although good, has too much screen time. Downey's Iron Man is never his old self at any time. Peter Parker's ok but not present for much of the movie & superfluous to the plot. Captain Marvel is basically Superman but with unpleasant attitude instead of character & functions entirely as a deus ex machine - a narrative device pretty much synonymous with copping out & failing as a writer.The only two characters who have a likeable part in the film pretty much are Antman, who gets a surprisingly large part in this movie, & the Hulk, whose initial appearance as a composite of Bruce Banner & the Hulk himself is actually genuinly intriguing for a short time. Unfortunately even this latter innovation works to diminish the character in the final battle where we don't even have the pleasure of seeing the Hulk properly smash everything up. Ultimately what is the point of a Hulk who is fully in control of himself?This is just a bad overblown movie that seems to take pleasure in down-sizing it's heroes in anticipation of a new greatly diminished future","[['Marvel', 'fanboy', 'cause', 'someone', 'this film', 'the hype', 'the knowledge', 'Avatar', 'the box', 'office', 'this film', 'a film', 'rail', 'the objection', 'some aspect',

9,Avengers: Endgame,Good but a mess in the story department...,"A nice production for those only interested in action sequences but not so great for those wanting closure of the Marvel story line...The best part of the film is that it brings together all previous Marvel movies to drive the plot... And the worst part of the film is it brings together all previous marvel movies to drive the plot... because it seems the production team don't really know the stories that ran before...
Anyone who follows the stories (from the movies, not the comic) will know there are much easier time points to collect each of the stones... The drama created by making this 'collection plan' much more difficult than it needed to be, added at least an unnecessary hour to the movie...Other plot points that didn't sit well with me and reduced the enjoyment of the movie, are...1) Thanos 'killed' 50% of the ""good guys"" and he's hailed as a super villain... Tony 'killed' 100% of the bad guys and he's a hero? Don't heroes learn from their own pain and sufferings and on principal refuse to inflict the same misery on others?Surely, other than Thanos and a few of his more loyal subjects, the rest are simply following orders...
(On another tangent, Thanos seems to really believe in his cause because after he killed off half the universe, including his people I believe, he lived alone and not with an army of servants and subjects for him to rule as a king... That's honourable...)2) they didn't reverse time... Just brought everyone back with a 5 year time gap... People should not behave normally when loved ones they haven't been with for 5 years suddenly reappear... Those who have survived those 5 years didn't get their memories and aging removed, right?3) how did Thanos and his gang all time travel while the avengers are so calculative about one person 2 trips?A 30 second segment showing Thanos instructing his people to mass produce the Pym solution for time travel would have closed this plot hole.4) always disliked Captain Marvel because she is so powerful that no other super heros need to exist...
And still... She is so concerned about other worlds that she couldn't be bothered to be present for the start of the biggest battle her home planet is about to face... when every known superhero showed up at the right time and right place...And later, the battle actually showed she's not all that great... So her weakness is she sweats the small stuff, can't see the big picture and not available/functional when needed?4) If they can bring back Gamora, why can't they find a timeline to bring back Natasha and even Tony? Superheros really don't like to plan and think things through... (Same as when they don't seek the easiest points to retrieve the stones... With zero time pressure for planning...)5) speaking of Gamora, the Gamora who came with Thanos don't know the guardian crew at all... so even though she's not 'evil' like the old Nabula, she wouldn't be friendly like she knows they are the 'good guys'...
Based on the time line, she doesn't even know Quill yet... So she should view him and them as the enemy in the battle...6) Nabula... If she killed her historic self, shouldn't she just drop dead in the new timeline?
Grandfather paradox anyone?7) what's with that special scene where all the women heroes joined together to show their power?
To me, that's totally sexist...Speaking for myself, I enjoy male and female superheros for their individual powers and weaknesses... Once a person reaches superhero status, in my mind, they crease to represent a gender (other than those gender/age stereotypes to generate laughs and endearment...)Having al female scene shows me that the production team are so hung up on being politically correct that they generate a reverse sexist scene to feel they are all inclusive... Sigh...
These same people want a female James Bond / Indiana Jones but not a male Mary Poppins / Eliza Doolittle... And they think the rest of the world is sexist...
The self proclaimed tolerant and inclusive are starting to paint themselves into a corner...8) while it's nice to see Bruce and the Hulk getting along...an unangry Hulk takes away what makes the Hulk a character...Remember these famous words? ""You wouldn't like me when I'm angry""... that's gone now... Sigh...9) speaking of which... Why on earth would the Hulk go into battle in an amour suit? Surely that was made for Bruce when the Hulk refused to come out to play?How would the Hulk fit inside and why would he need it? That's taking power away from the Hulk and it pissed me off...10) if the Ancient One knows and sees all possibilities... Even knowing when Dr Strange will show up... How did she not see the Hulk coming to ask for the stone?11) Loki's escape with the tesseract surely would have spun an alternate time line... Since there is only ONE tesseract... Then much of the previous stories wouldn't really make sense if Loki had it almost immediately after he lost it ...12) Captain America basically anointed the Falcon to be the next Capt? *Roll eyes*...I think the Falcon already has a lot going and Bucky should be a better successor...
In any case, we won't see Thor succeed the iron Man suit because he doesn't really need the extra edge...
Bucky is a super soldier in the same vein as the Capt. And should have been his first choice for a successor...13) did Captain America just ignore world events for the last century while he hid with Peggy? (& what did he do after she died... Surely she can't live as long as he... Wouldn't he simply come back to the 'present' having enjoyed a full and loving life, and not yet as old as he became?) ... The Production team might wish to rewatch Highlander...😋He never got the itch to help the 'current' Captain America fight injustice? He resisted the urge to pass on information that might help the avengers as he had lived through all the events before? (I know, I know... Can't/shouldn't change history... But how could he resist, for someone like him who loves to lecture and lead?)14) the biggest plot hole of all and the one that buried the movie for me... is...The Thanos that was in the battle came from before the previous movie right? (Infinity war)...If Tony Stark kills Thanos in this movie... That means none of the previous movie plot could have happened... Nobody was ""killed off"" (not even Loki...)... Nobody lost/gained 5 years of their lives... Thor didn't need to get fat, none of this movie should even get started...That's the devil when idiot film makers dabble with time travel in a non-time-travel movie... Adding this means they can't take care of the details properly...The above are just the main plot annoyances... And there and many other smaller ones which prevented a truly epic movie experience...3 hours is a long movie and much of it unnecessary if they tightened the plot to make more sense...So, while the movie is good...I wouldn't selectively watch it again... Which to me is the benchmark of a great movie.I'm torn in giving a rating... I want to give 7 based on the scale of the production and emotional ties it has on me from all the previous Marvel movies...But the constant I'm jolted with throughout the film killed much of my buzz and for that I want to give it a 2... Sto be fair... it'll get a 4 overall to balance both sides...","[['A nice production', 'action', 'those wanting closure', 'Marvel', 'story', 'line', 'part', 'the film', 'Marvel', 'the plot', 'part',

11,Avengers: Endgame,Was it just me or did Dr Strange give us the finger towards the end?,"Whaaaat? Time travel? Really? No way I saw 'this' coming... Except, I did. Oh no, Ironman and Black Widow are dead. Boohoo! Except nobody ever DIES in these movies (like the Red Skull-cough cough). They'll be brought back by some sort cloning technology or with some weird voodoo magic (...or time travel). It worked for Deadpool after all. The avengers literally couldn't go on any further. I mean the violence kind of escalated when they destroyed a city, then a small country, then a planet and finally the entire universe! You can't trump that! Although... Buffy the vampire slayer did save the multiverse. Was it just me or did Dr Strange gave the audience the literal finger towards the end? He did but this movie is PG13 so it wasn't that finger. Like everyone else who has a modicum of intelligence I too thought Thanos's motive was moronic as well as it was dumb. Try to follow my reasoning. He snaps his fingers and half the Universe's population is gone. What are the survivors going to do? Hmmm? The most logical thing is they will just breed again and then we're back to square one. We can't just assume that all species have the same gestation period as humans do. An elephant for instance has the gestation period of about 22 months, a whale about 16 months, a horse about 12 months, and cat and dogs about 58 DAYS... What about rabbits and rats? Oh about 22 days. My point is some species will repopulate their losses in a matter of days depending on how advanced their technology is or how fertile they are (we have no idea how aliens do their funny business and we don't want to know-just saying). So wiping out half the population isn't going to solve anything, quite the contrary. Humans would take about thirty to forty years to repopulate. In the meantime, you're going to have chaos and destruction following when people are suddenly disappearing when cars are suddenly crashing, planes are falling from the skies and nuclear reactors are going off or when nuclear silos are suddenly unguarded. All this would require more resources to be used to contain the chaos that would follow. Earth is tiny and we have limited resources, but the Universe has UNLIMITED resources! The Universe is very huge, LIKE HUMONGOUS HUGE! Any species that has mastered space technology can simply colonise an asteroid or planet and mine the heck out of it. Now, Thanos has a magic gauntlet which theoretically can give him whatever his giant heart desires. Even Thanos eventually acknowledges that his original plan is dumb and decides to recreate the Universe. Now THAT should have been his original plan. That I could understand. The Avengers used time travel to fix their problems... (Sigh-this is literally the laziest writing ever). The first time he snapped his fingers and kills half the Universe's population he becomes a gardener... A gardener! That is his endgame? Pointless genocide: check! Now I will go to my cucumber and tomato paradise: check! I wonder if Dr. Strange saw this in every one of his 14,000,605 outcomes and lost his mind. Did Dr Strange get so frustrated with all those versions ending up with Thanos gardening that he just gave up and gave him the stone? Why didn't Thanos dedicate himself to botany instead of being a warlord? I bet that by 14,000,606 it was the first time that it didn't end up with Thanos ending up in his cucumber and tomato paradise. So Ironman died because of some vegetables. That one version that Dr Strange wanted. Now let's talk about a geriatric Captain America (how did the writers come up this). Captain America goes back in time to be with the love of his life... How charming! Except that it isn't. He is a superhero with powers and knowledge of the future and the cold war and other really important stuff. Is he going to sit back while Hydra takes over SHIELD and destroys the very America he loves so much? What about Bucky who is being used as the Winter Soldier?

15,Avengers: Endgame,The End of an Era!,"After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.On the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.Of course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.Lastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10","[['Avengers Infinity War', 'Endgame'], ['the story', 'the end', 'Thanos'], [], ['Endgame', 'anticipated film'], ['the expectation', 'the probability', 'disappointment'], ['the case', 'Endgame'], ['the film'], ['concern', 'the film', 'the other hand', 'another comparison'], ['Endgame', 'Infinity War'], ['Avengers Infinity War', 'the beginning', 'the story'], ['Endgame', 'the finale', 'the story'], [], ['story', 'Endgame', 'a great homage', 'the ten-year history', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe'], ['The story', 'Avengers', 'team'], ['Iron Man', 'Captain America', 'Thor', 'Hulk', 'Black Widow', 'Hawkeye', 'the center'], ['No character', 'front'], ['course', 'an important role', 'the story', 'Avengers', 'team'], ['Everyone', 'concern', 'Captain Marvel', 'Marvel', 'world'], [], ['this struggle'], ['the fore'], ['good message', 'a hero', 'a family.Of course', 'Avengers Endgame'], ['example', 'the three-hour period', 'the story'], [], ['The head', 'the story', 'the rest'], ['an emotional predicament'], ['the tempo'], ['the movie', 'action'], [], ['Action', 'battle'], ['a slight distress'], ['the film', 'the story', 'meaningless', 'insignificant', 'Endgame', 'a movie', 'end', 'scene'], ['the film', 'no need', 'another scene'], ['Marvel', 'legend', 'Stan Lee', 'a small stage'], ['the last surprise', 'scene', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe'], ['no clue', 'Marvel', 'future'], ['Spider-Man', 'Far', 'Home'], []]","[['Avengers Infinity War', 'Avengers Endgame'], ['story', 'heroes', 'end of Thanos'], ['Many theories'], ['Avengers Endgame', 'anticipated film', 'recent years'], ['expectation', 'probability of disappointment'], ['case for Endgame'], ['film'], ['concern', 'film', 'other hand', 'comparison'], ['Endgame', 'Infinity War'], ['Avengers Infinity War', 'beginning', 'story'], ['Endgame', 'finale', 'story'], ['films', 'separate stories'], ['story', 'parts.Avengers Endgame', 'great homage', 'ten-year history', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe'], ['story', 'Avengers team'], ['Iron Man', 'Captain America', 'Thor', 'Hulk', 'Black Widow', 'Hawkeye', 'center of events'], ['character', 'front'], ['course', 'many characters', 'important role', 'story', 'Avengers team'], ['Everyone', 'concern', 'Captain Marvel', 'Marvel world', 'other heroes'], [], ['struggle'], ['fore', 'areas'], ['good message', 'hero', 'family.Of course', 'Avengers Endgame', 'critical aspects'], ['example', 'three-hour period', 'terms', 'story'], [], ['head', 'story moves', 'rest'], ['heroes', 'emotional predicament'], ['tempo', 'heavy scenes'], ['minutes', 'movie', 'action'], ['minutes'], ['Action', 'battle scenes'], ['slight distress', 'visual effects'], ['slight logic errors', 'film', 'story', 'details', 'meaningless and insignificant', 'Avengers Endgame', 'movie end scene'], ['film', 'need', 'scene'], ['Marvel legend Stan Lee', 'small stage'], ['surprise scene', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe'], ['clue about Marvel', 'future'], ['Spider-Man', 'Far from Home'], []]"

It could have been refined. Many of the characters were inserted and wasted.Length: It was unnecessarily prolonged, esp towards the end. They could have reduced the runtime by 20-30 minutes.Overall: Bad. Barely a one time watch, with lots of patience. The studios have created the hype and made their money.

21,Avengers: Endgame,Why?,"I hate how people are saying that this movie is epic, and that all the movies that preceded it were epic as well. There have only been a handful of Marvel movies that have actually been good, and this is not one of them.Marvel, like The Simpsons, has run out of ideas and is now running off of a therom. If it has the word marvel in it, then it will sell. The story does not matter only the name, and it's finally starting to show, as it has for The Simpsons for years now. And the announcement of new movies is now no longer exciting for me.Marvel honestly needs to take a step back and take their time in producing movies, as well as shows now too, like some of their most fantastic movies and shows, like the original Iron Man, Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-Man, and even the Netflix Daredevil, which was surprisingly good and did a great job portraying the character. What the executives at Marvel don't seem to understand is that they in fact are not Epic, they're just putting trash out and unfortunately the masses are gobbling it up. Things become like goats, they'll eat anything that you put in front of them.End game is one of the most unimpressive movies I've seen in a very long time. I cannot believe that I wasted almost four hours of my life watching this horrible, sad excuse for a superhero movie, if you could even call it that. The only great thing about the past few Marvel movies is the memes that have come out of it. The Russo Brothers Legacy will be the memes that were made from their movies, not the story itself nor the movies. Just because you have the lucasfilm lighting, as well as the CGI company behind you does not make you amazing. What makes anything amazing, story-wise is a good story. End game doesn't even have that! They paid Robert Downey jr. 75 million dollars for the only good scene in the entire film, and it only lasts a couple of seconds. What a waste of money.For the love of God stop going to see Marvel movies and teach them a lesson to stop making horrible movies they aren't even superhero movies anymore. Stan Lee is gone, even when he was alive he didn't stop these terrible movies from being made, because he believed in Marvel and that it could change the world. In the beginning it did, with the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man's, Iron Man, and all of these amazing Marvel films that were actually well done and good. Stan Lee near the end, just produced these films because that's all that he knew to do. He inherently trusted these people to make great movies, and honestly they failed him and failed the original image of Marvel. Only the comics have stayed true, and even then they've come to PC for my liking, and it's so sad. Marvel won't be getting any more of my money.

22,Avengers: Endgame,"Too long, Overrated, Mediocre, Badly Paced, Etc","Couldn't believe how long this film was when I heard! 3 hours is just overwhelmingly bad if you ask me but still considering that I seen the previous 3 films I had to give this one a chance at least once.Went into this knowing the torture of watching a 3 hour film with an over stretched story line, plot holes galore, dragged scenes & political correctness shoved down your throat & that wasn't even the icing on the cake!But then after watching I found the film was below 3 hours. Actually, it was 2 hours & 49 minutes in total, but that's no far off the 3 hour mark. The film itself was ok & I mean below mediocre at best & at worst overrated!The story-line was easy enough to follow, but still had some confusing points which weren't well executed. Like the part where they traveled back in time & they were fighting their past selves. Other plot points too which didn't illustrate well what was happening or what was what.The run time which is obviously the biggest let down also contributed to the dragging nature which stretched out a story-line so simple it could've snapped! The ending especially was like watching paint dry in slow motion & my arse felt pretty numb when I left the cinema.There was some good action parts but there isn't much goes to say about this film or others like it which are clearly forgettable & loaded with confusing story-lines, details & sci-fi overkill.I also didn't appreciate the political correctness & female feminazi empowerment in this film which I seen twice at the finale part. A black woman at the end being ""king"" or ""leader"" of the land instead of Thor really? I don't know... I'd say that political correctness itself is just part of the issue I have with these films overall. It needs to stop!Overall not good & seriously over hyped for what it is! I can safely say these films have gone down hill since the beginning of the 2010's. They've delved into too much sci-fi, complicated story-lines with too much details, are too up in the air & not grounded enough & are riddled with political correctness!

26,Avengers: Endgame,"Shallow, dull, boring, unemotional, rubbish","Warning spoilers a plenty.I thought it was utter rubbish, complete drivel. Nearly everything was off and wrong about this bore-fest.Almost nothing happened. It was so boring. Virtually the entire first 90 minutes could have been trimmed to about 15 mins.Pacing was terrible, it lost all momentum at times and was tedious.
The feel of the film, was all over the place, jumping from very dumb childish comedy to attempted serious drama and then to social commentary. It didn't natural have a core or flow to the film.So many stupid, misplaced scenes, such as the ""girl power"" nonsense, so contrived.Massive plot holes. I know Time Travel is a very difficult subject to tackle, but this made little sense. Either you cannot change the past or you can? This sometimes does and other times doesn't. If you steal the Stones then try to put them back. In theory they haven't been stolen, as you can't change the past, therefore, how can you put them back? How on earth did Captain America manage to put the Stones back and Thor's hammer and presumably the Green girl? They erased Thanos and the Robot girl in same timeline as well and that didn't effect anything?Apparently you can't kill a baby Thanos, but you can kill a slightly younger adult version of Thanos when he comes to the future that is okay.How did Capt A, put the Stones back at the exact time they left, without interfering with the original operation to retrieve them or changing the past anyway.The cringe worthy comedy was awful. There was a serious tone to Avengers, but this just turned into a cheap gag reel. Thors (a god) getting fat. Hulk getting fans.Corny cheap false scenes with Tony and his daughter, with the terrible music playing at the same time, like some cheap matinee from the 50's.Overall there was no feeling or emotion, the funeral scene was false and contrived.Pepper Potts is now Iron Woman?Spider-man goes back to school, after 5 years away?

29,Avengers: Endgame,"Was promised a chocolate cake, turned out to be cake of manure.","Let's be clear - there was a lot of talking about this film, about how great it will be. Turned out? It was a pretty decent story about time traveling (I honestly like those). I even thought I like it, aside from some little things that don't even worth mentioning. But the ending - oh, let me talk about the ending. It is so horrible that it erased any good impression this movie could've left. I don't have the problem with how it ends, with events presented. I have the problem with how boring, non-aesthetic and amateur it was filmed. I'm furious that funeral scene turned out to be such a cheap vulgarity, such an emptiness that tries to play with viewer's emotions - and, sadly, fails. This is what the character died for? To be honored... With this? Boy, oh boy. I don't know how many people actually like this scene, but I sure do not.
Also - diversity. As a commercial product in the first place, a movie about diverse characters, well, completely non-diversed. Heteronormative, I would say, and in 2019 it is quite anachronistic. Quite obvious, of course, that the company is afraid of possible risks and profit losses - another reason to think about what good such soulless capitalistic approach can give us? From where I stand, nothing good. I don't want to be a consumer, I want to be a viewer that is not treated like a money account. Anyway, I was bitter about it just a little - after all, what can you expect from Marvel and Russos, really? They are not Taika Waititi after all (how honestly great it would be if Taika Waititi filmed all Avengers movies is story for another time), so even queer-coding isn't present. What got me furious is that Russo had the nerves to actually say they included LGBT-representation there. Leaving alone term ""LGBT-representation"" and why I have problems with this phrasing, let's see what we have here. And what we have, fellow viewers who don't enjoy tasteless similarity in their films, is a huge slap on our faces and our egos. This is what we can call a proper representation these days? I doubt it. It's so elusive I even didn't noticed it in the first place, thinking that the man could be talking about any people from his family. So, if I can read a text hermeneutically and headcanon some queer characters in there, does that mean a film has representation in it? Or, more important, does it mean director has the right to be bragging about such representation?

The fact that the Russo Brothers and Kevin Feige himself have to spoon feed you how brilliant and amazing this movie is goes to show how.bad it truly is.The characters that we all once knew and loved have now become boring, robotic sleeves to Disney.

We can't move, the room is dark, and then Kevin Feige and The Russo Brothers turn on the blinding lights and all walk in with spoons in their hands.

31,Avengers: Endgame,Could have been a lot better,"So a handful of heroes fight all the way to the climactic end of the movie, and then they lose the chance to finish what they started. I am not going to spoil it, but watching a million CGI characters appear on both sides was like letting all the air out of the tires. All the dramatic build-up was lost when it became a billions against billions battle.Which brings up the fact that at least 90 minutes of this movie is spent on boring scenes of various Avengers feeling depressed about the death of the heroes, and going to support group meetings. We get it. The Avengers are depressed. This could have been covered in fifteen minutes or less in a group meeting. We did not need to follow each Avenger through their depressing trip down memory lane. Thank God Ant Man came back from the quantum universe and got the ball rolling!!Unfortunately, Thor becomes the punchline for jokes throughout the movie. Since Captain Marvel is the new #1 hero, they had to power down Thor by turning him into a drunken hobo. The Incredible Hulk has spent the past three movies (Thor Ragnarok, Infinity War, & this one) in permanent erectile dysfunction, and he continues to be a zero in this movie. Thor and the Hulk are just here to be the focus of comedy as has-beens. Even Bruce Banner as a scientist gets slapped down. Michael Douglas and the Pym Particles have to fix what Bruce Banner fails to do. It is a very sad way for two of Marvel's earliest and most powerful heroes to end their game.There are a lot of good moments in Endgame. Most of them happen when the small crew of Avengers is trying to find the original gems. Then the battle when it is just the small group against Thanos is excellent. It was building up to a great ending, Captain America & Iron Man defeating Thanos, against all odds. Even Thor was redeeming himself in the battle! That is how this Marvel Comics masterpiece could have ended. But they had to throw in the billions of CGI characters and turn it into a big circus act... Too bad.

32,Avengers: Endgame,Maybe the worst Marvel movie?,"I am not a huge fan of the last Marvel movies. There are some very good movies, but the most is around average. Never so bad as most of the last DC movies. But Endgame is really game over for me.Please continue with X-men and guardians of the galaxy. It is enough for me. The rest I do not care anymore, it is ok like this. They professionally ruined it for me with Endgame.The story is very shallow, the solution is very shallow and also the action scenes are very shallow. Hours long they are busy with: yes we have something, but I have doubts, but it is great, but I don't know etc. And ofcourse all the heroes are very hurt and some are saying no at first, but already fast they overcome their hurt... And by the way: let's do some time traveling! Let's redo all the finding of the stones and snap the fingers a few times, it makes live so easy.So you have a 'big battle' where nothing happens and some action and after that it is saying goodbye to everybody. Oh wait! We forgot to think about a few death people, we just push commemorating them somewhere in the scenes. Iron man is the most important. Oh and captain Marvel is fixing everything ofcourse. I think she can save the whole universe on her own, who need the Avengers? And captain America has his ending: he is much older and guess what he did al that years? We do not need to guess because even that is explained, like we can not think for ourselves.Are there no good points?

33,Avengers: Endgame,"This may have the quickest turn around for any ""remake"" in history. Coupled with Infinity War it is the low point of the MCU","Several of the narrative problems that are present in Infinity War are not resolved or made worse by this remarkably lazy film. Of note, Thanos' ideology is both utterly incoherent and utterly alien to the Zeitgeist. The writers simply lacked the courage to make Thanos into the eugenicist that he so clearly should be. Without that edge to him he is a scene chewing comic book *villain* in the worse way. I simply did not care about the plot because the villain is a snidely whiplash joke. The film doubles down on the idiocy present in Infinity War as Thanos' end goal is just more so. This problem renders the film hollow, emotionally inert.That might have been overlooked if the film's overall structure wasn't, more or less, identical to Infinity War. Starting at about 30 minutes in the two films run remarkably in parallel with each other. The pieces are slightly jumbled and certain characters end up playing different beats but act to act, sequence to sequence, scene to scene the underlying scaffolding of the plot is the same. This would be better if the plotting wasn't redundant in the first place. Infinity War boiled down to 6 color coded chase scenes over MacGruffins. The same is true in Endgame but even more so. The plot device introduced to allow the team a fighting chance produces whole manners of plot contrivances, incoherence and murky what the heck is happening. There are 21 other films in the series and while I have seen every single one (some more than 3 times!) I simply don't have the convoluted metaphysics memorized. If you saw each film once in the theatre as they were released parts of this mess will confuse you.On that note the Infinity Stones are even more MacGruffins in this film as Endgame doesn't even bother to try to visualize their various powers. Infinity War turned magick users into mere boxers and this film continues to lower the bar for imaginative use of space magick. I still don't understand what the difference between, say, the space stone and reality stone is practically. There is nothing in the film that demonstrates their powers. This adds to the rote laziness that the film embodies.Inevitably in a film like this a few characters will get short changed. This happened here to my favorite character. For a film that so copied its predecessor's structure I am gobsmacked that not all re-matches occurred in the action scenes. Some of them do, but a pretty obvious and possibly entertaining one doesn't. On top of that the final moment-key to a character and the plot- is overly telegraphed due to the extraordinary amount of time spent with said character and the seeming checklist they have for a farewell tour. The balance is wrong for the character relationships. You can more or less guess the consequences based on screen time.None of the consequences of the two films seem final, abet textually a few of them are (I guess). Capital being what it is Disney would never kill off a bunch of Golden Geese; it was always faintly absurd the two films pretended otherwise. This narrative holdover from Infinity War takes a lot of heat out of the film.There are a few nice quips. There are also some promising team up moments in the film that point to brighter days.

40,Avengers: Endgame,A Time Travel Convoluted Mess.,"333. Avengers: Endgame. After the events of Infinity War, which did not last for infinity, cell phone gamer Thermos got his wish he deleted half his apps on his phone, after collecting all the Bejeweled gems. So what now? Well, those of the game app The Avengers that are left, get mad, so they stroll over to Thermos' place and behead him, rather easily... the excuse is, cause he was worn out and weak after using the stones, yea ok lets go with that. So what now? The End? Right??? No, they're not satisfied with the realization that in war people die, even the good guys, so the answer is: Time Travel. Thus a convoluted plan is born to travel through time, getting the stones back to create the game glove to bring all the dead folks back. So by now I've sure you've seen it, so spoilers be damned and my issue with the ending... The Captain America time line... The movie states, all other time travel movies are wrong, they're rules are right. You jump through to a different time, that is your reality now. So the Avengers plan works, though they screw up each timeline they go to, giving Disney enough material to make alternate universe versions of the same movie forever, oh wait, they do that now... The final act is for the Captain to bring the final stone back, to his original time and come back, to i guess rebuild and get ready for Avengers 5, i dunno. But he decides to stay back then and make a life with his lost lady love, creating his own new timeline, where he still got all muscley apparently, however this would mean that all the events of the MCU did not take place in the Captains new timeline, so when he randomly shows up as an old man to the spot where he left the other timeline, a timeline he ended by leaving it...the events of his life were drastically different and in creating this new time line, the others are null and void because they now exist in an alternate universe where old Steve Rogers does not. If your gonna say all other time travel movies are wrong, at least follow your own rules.

44,Avengers: Endgame,Avengers Paradox,"I didn't find this movie all that interesting. I felt it was about as good as Infinity Wars. This film feels like a complete ripoff of the last episode of Star Trek Voyager that was also called Endgame and also involved time travel. I don't mind when time travel is used in a movie or tv show as long as it makes some sense and somewhat consistent within the universe and doesn't leave giant gaping holes everywhere. This movie failed hard with the time travel stuff. I don't recall time travel being an aspect in the MCU, so whipping out the good old time travel trope randomly required way too much suspension of disbelief for me.The fact that Tony Stark created a time machine overnight just blew my mind that someone actually thought it was a good idea to put it in the movie. The Professor Hulk stuff mind numbingly ridiculous. I'm confused as to why it was decided that Banner would just be Professor Hulk for this movie. It didn't add anything to the movie and made his character boring. Alcoholic, overweight comedic relief Thor destroyed Thor's character. It's not really even explained why he turned into an alcoholic bum. He decapitates Thanos within the first 5 minutes of the movie and the next time we see him, he's an alcoholic raging over video games. Honestly, nothing is really explained in this 3 hour movie. The directors thought it was best to like 90 minutes that added zilch to the filmThe time travel in the film renders all the other films in the MCU as pointless. There are no consequences for anyone's actions. The Avengers failed in Infinity War, but good thing Tony Stark created a time machine to fix past failures. Paradoxes be damned and the ""rules"" of time travel can just be changed at anytime as this movie did.The thing at the end with Captain America putting back all the stones in their original time line didn't make sense as how he'd be able to even do that. The movie couldn't be bothered to show him doing that either. Him going back to 1940 to be with Peggy Carter doesn't make sense either and messes up his character. Did he just sit and watch all this bad stuff happen throughout the years? Why didn't it create an alternate universe?Just all around dull movie. It would've been better if the Avengers traveled to an alternate universe to get the stones instead of time travel. Then there wouldn't have been as many gaping holes in this film.

47,Avengers: Endgame,Per For Pre Pubescent Kids,"I'm going to make a leap here, just to leep things simple. The cumulative effect of so called ""super heroes"" is to the true film fan what the white man was to Native Americans: End of life as they knew it. There are 25 actors in this, and it's really sad to see them become prostitutes, like their studios. Why do you think great actors and directors wouldn't be caught dead in these cartoon films? Because they are the antithesis to great film making. Its really sad. I understand my 13 year old daughter seeing something like this. I don't understand older, more mature people acting like these are real films becauseT they arent. They are like the cartoons you woukd watch, before the main attraction started. They all have been dumbed down for the masses to the same exact plot: Good versus Evil; always. I wouldn't, no couldn't; sit through 15 minute of this pablum, not even if you paid me a year's salary to watch. It""s woeful trash, and is ruining the film industry. Stanley Kubrick the master of all the great directors, is rolling over in his grave. You won't see the top directors making any of this trash. People like Abel Ferrara, Marty Scorcese, Ridley Scott, William Friedkin, Spike Lee, or Denis Villeneuve go near a movie such as this. Its all publicity! All you hear about is how much money is made in the opening weeks, but nothing about what the films are like. It makes me sick. I would rather have my teeth drilled without novacaine than watch this. The same goes for the best actors.

54,Avengers: Endgame,a reunion show more than an avengers movie.,"I didn't like end game much. to long. to slow. to sloppy, to weak of a plot. to many cameos.thanos had to much physical power, all the other superheros got their power from outside sources, his was never explained. is it supposed to be his is born that way? even in infinity war he had to much physical strength. of which i didnt like the beginning of showing the end of 'thor, ragnorock, victorious ending being totally useless. a better ending and more tense/suspenseful scene would have been showing them fly off towards thanos ship in waiting.if thanos got his strength from some unnatural method, i missed that being explained. then why no others like him? comics say he is a titan. why no other titans?the key points in the movie's end fight scenes were far to subtle and why did iron man have to die because he used the glove? it was never explained. thanos never suffered using them, only destroying them. and so many others had it, why didn't they use it? even if it would kill them, whether they knew it would kill them or not, they could have ended it all instantly.the time travel thing was oh so sloppy. seems it was used only to go over the list of all the other movies. was more like a reunion documentary than an actual movie. bored the crap out of me. and the stupid mistakes made me upset.so now they have all the stones, with or without a glove, why did they need time travel machines to go back again to replace them? wouldnt the stones have let them do what they wanted to do, restoring any history they wished, one without thanos? and they could have brought back vision, why didnt they? etc etc etc.captain marvel was vastly wasted. so was her haircut. what was the point of that? she said she was needed elsewhere? who cares whats happening in the rest of the universe when its not going to matter after the glove puts it all back right. the only and the smartest thing about the movie was when thanos took her power stone to beat her. that was the best 10 seconds in the movie. but with that stone, they should have been equal. but then not equal because thanos isnt strong enough to smash entire ships by himself like captain marvel is. she is, without a doubt, by far the strongest character and that strength was not used.oh ya, that the glove just had to get back to him was such a joke of a cliche. again, should have been used before. the center point of the movie should have been making use of the glove by other means.thanos and the glove. he is smart enough to build a vast empire, yet he can only think to use the glove to kill. not to created a better method of existence without killing? he not so smart after all. and neither are any of the others for not suggesting something of that sort.the time travel thing should have put it all back right from the point of before thanos snapped fingers. should have gone back to the point where star lord should have shot thanos and ended it all, and then actually shoot him and end it all. of which that star lord didnt shoot him was the stupidest and weakest part of infinity wars. he was going to kill him but got so upset at him that he didnt kill him. huh? how does that work? who else would not have instantly shot thanos upon hearing such news?the only thing this movie was successful for was giving out as many paycheques as possible. the most cameos any movie ever had. did they really need to do that? showing 3 second clips at the end in the credits of each actor would have been better. at least less boring.they didnt just want to end the story line, they wanted to end my interest in it also. i watched them all just to make sure i didnt miss anything that might have been worth while. some of the others were just great. this one was far from it.","[['game'], [], [], ['a plot'], ['physical power', 'power'], ['way'], ['infinity', 'war', 'much physical strength'], ['the beginning', 'the end', ""'thor"", 'ragnorock'], ['tense/suspenseful scene', 'strength', 'some unnatural method', 'i'], [], ['a titan'], ['the movie', 'end', 'fight', 'iron', 'man', 'the glove'], [], [], [], ['all instantly.the time', 'travel thing'], ['the list'], ['a reunion', 'documentary', 'an actual movie'], ['the crap'], ['a glove', 'time', 'travel'], ['any history'], ['vision', 'didnt'], ['marvel'], ['haircut'], ['the point'], [], ['the rest', 'the universe', 'the glove', 'right'], ['thing', 'the movie', 'power', 'stone'], ['the movie'], ['that stone'], ['thanos', 'isnt', 'captain', 'marvel'], ['a doubt', 'character', 'strength', 'used.oh ya', 'the glove', 'a joke', 'a cliche'], [], ['the center', 'point', 'the movie', 'use', 'the glove', 'the glove'], ['a vast empire', 'the glove'], ['method', 'existence'], [], ['something', 'that sort.the time', 'travel thing', 'right', 'the point'], ['the point', 'star', 'lord'], ['that star', 'lord', 'didnt', 'part', 'infinity'], [], ['huh'], ['work'], ['such news', 'the only thing', 'this movie'], ['any movie'], [], ['the end', 'each actor'], ['boring.they didnt', 'the story', 'line', 'interest'], ['i', 'sure i didnt', 'miss', 'anything'], [], ['this one']]","[['game'], [], [], ['plot'], ['many cameos.thanos', 'physical power', 'other superheros', 'power', 'outside sources'], ['way'], ['infinity war', 'much physical strength'], ['beginning', ""end of 'thor"", 'ragnorock'], ['tense/suspenseful scene', 'towards thanos', 'waiting.if thanos', 'strength', 'unnatural method', 'i'], ['others'], ['comics', 'titan'], ['other titans', 'key points', 'movie', 'end fight scenes', 'iron man', 'glove'], [], ['thanos'], ['many others'], ['instantly.the time', 'travel thing'], ['list', 'other movies'], ['reunion documentary', 'actual movie'], ['crap'], ['stupid mistakes', 'stones', 'glove', 'time travel machines'], ['stones', 'history', 'thanos'], ['vision', 'didnt'], ['marvel'], ['haircut'], ['point'], [], ['whats', 'rest', 'universe', 'glove', 'right'], ['thing', 'movie', 'power stone'], ['seconds', 'movie'], ['stone'], ['thanos isnt', 'entire ships', 'captain marvel'], ['doubt', 'character', 'strength', 'used.oh ya', 'glove', 'joke', 'cliche'], [], ['center point', 'movie', 'use', 'glove', 'other means.thanos', 'glove'], ['vast empire', 'glove'], ['method of existence'], [], ['others', 'something', 'sort.the time', 'travel thing', 'right', 'point of before thanos', 'fingers'], ['point', 'star lord', 'thanos'], ['star lord didnt', 'part of infinity wars'], [], ['huh'], ['work'], ['thanos', 'such news', 'only thing', 'movie', 'many paycheques'], ['movie'], [], ['second clips', 'end', 'credits', 'actor'], ['boring.they didnt', 'story line', 'interest'], ['i', 'didnt miss anything'], ['others'], ['one']]"

If you like a good, intriguing, believable story with interesting characters then this movie may be very lacking in that department. The characters with all their interesting super powers just seemed to be a bore. Perhaps this sort of thing happens when you have too many main characters in one movie. There is no character development. One thing there is no shortage of is good looking special effects but it merely covers up the inadequacy of any kind of substance in the story lines and characters.The story totally contradicts itself. I'm not going to post spoilers in this review but in the end it really looked like the writers just made up unrealistic stuff that did not make any sense or had any sort of believable realism. If you tell a story like a 3 year old, other 3 year olds are going to love your story but adults are going to be bored to tears.They turned almighty Thor into a 3 year old, with mannerisms, intellect and all the traits 3 year olds display.

Total Hollywood cheese which really didn't work.They will no doubt make another Captain America movie so why end it like that?

61,Avengers: Endgame,Omissions and Plot Holes Galore!,"SPOILERS Ahead!!! Turn back now!!Endgame brings MORE plot holes and nonsense. How can this be??Part One of the Avengers movie (Infinity War) oozed into theaters in Spring of 2018. It was not what I expected and I was pretty vocal in my dislike of the film. I stand by that review.Spring of 2019 brought us Part Two (Endgame). I motored over to my local multiplex and plopped down to watch and be amazed. As I sat munching my popcorn before the feature I kept thinking. ""It's going to be okay. It's really going to be okay. It can't be as bad as the first film. It's going to be okay.""It was NOT okay.How is it possible that this film is even worse than Part One? That should not be possible, right? But it is. I'll attribute most of the 'bad' to the fact that the movies were shot simultaneously. For some reason the whole Betty Botter tongue twister is rattling around in my head. I suppose because the Russos needed some better butter to make their bitter batter better. Evidently, they couldn't find any.Because the 'batter' is bitter y'all!So many things went wrong here. Let's start at the beginning. We spend the first hour of this snooze fest in a never ending loop of 'where's waldo' to catch up on some of the folk that are left after Thanos snapped his fingers and killed off half of life in the universe in Infinity War. Stark is floating in space with Nebula running out of oxygen and food. Everyone is depressed. Thor is super depressed. Enter Captain Marvel who brings Stark and Nebula to earth. Does she stay to help? Nope. She flies off to help other planets that don't have an 'avengers'. Whoa, wait...I thought she was supposed to save the day, trounce Thanos. I thought this would be her moment. No? We have to save the world and find Thanos on our own? Huh! The team decides to find Thanos, take back the stones and reverse the first snapping. Thor whacks off Thanos' head when they learn Thanos destroyed the stones and there will be no do over.The snooze fest continues 'Five Years Later'.Ant Man escapes the quantum realm (plot hole...cos how did he do that, exactly?) He finds Black Widow and Captain America and explains that he's only been gone 5 hours 'cause 'time moves differently in the quantum realm.' (say what?) Captain America is leading a 'touchy feely' grief counseling encounter group with one of the directors (Joe Russo) providing a cameo as a grieving spouse. This was our gay moment that we were promised and it almost slips by unnoticed.Moving on.The group approaches Stark to do the time travel reset. He initially blows them off because he has a life and a kid. However, he puts all that to the side because of the loss of Peter Parker. We gotta have Spiderman back because his next movie is in the pipeline. Bruce Banner and the Hulk have found the peace Jekyll and Hyde never did and are happily signing autographs, taking selfies and blissfully not remembering that Hulk wussed out in Infintity War because Thanos kicked his green butt. Thor is living in New Asgard in squalor with his buddies Korg and Miek, drinking copious amounts of alcohol, porking up on snacks and developing a substantial beer belly. Hawkeye has turned into a vigilante and is systematically wiping out bad guys to avenge his family and improve the world. Yeah, whatever works.The whole 'stone heist' segment of the film was like a bad version of any of the Ocean's movies except all the bad that went on was not thought out ahead or planned. In fact, the movie jokes about the improbability of time travel by referencing a ton of movies (from Back to the Future to Star Trek) and saying 'that's not the way it works'. One problem...they never really explain how time travel 'really' works because nothing in the whole process was consistent. Do you or don't you interact with your former self? Maybe, maybe not. Will all be returned to its 'pre Thanos' snapped' glory? Not really. Will all our favorites come back to life? Ehhh...not quite (Loki and Vision are not brought back and I'm STILL upset about that!) Will what you do in the past change your timeline? Depends on what you want to do? What happens if you decide to stay in the past or your past self comes to the future? Why quibble over minutiae? Plot hole after plot hole opens up and we're supposed to just swallow the blue pill and believe whatever we're told...however cockeyed that may be.Captain Marvel does come back to take out Thanos' ship and join with the other women (in a heavy handed obligatory feminist moment that is so contrived) to do battle with Thanos and keep him away from the glove. I had hoped that this would be Captain Marvel's moment. I thought she would put on the glove, snap her fingers and we'd all go back to business as usual. But no. She makes no attempt to put the glove on herself. Really?? Tony Stark uses his tech to transfer the stones from Thanos' glove to his, snap his fingers, and turn Thanos and all his minions to dust. But...but...we had been lead to believe that Captain Marvel was the pinnacle of super heroes. Guess Captain Marvel didn't get that memo. So why did we even need a Captain Marvel origin story? We could have had a Black Widow origin story. We were already invested in her character. Plus Scarlett is a better actress than Brie. She just is.What is so frustrating is none of this is a surprise. Not one thing. We know that Steve is going to stay with Peggy. We know that Black Widow is going to sacrifice herself for the Soul Stone. We know the effects of the first snapping will be successfully reversed. The Russos telegraph every single plot point (and I use the word 'plot' loosely because there wasn't one). The dialog was so basic that I found myself speaking it before the characters did. I hate when that happens because it's never a good sign in a first-run film that I've never seen and which I did not Google or read a single review.This film was a monumental waste of time. I waited ten years for this. I waited TEN years for THIS??
I rated the movie a '3' because I got to see some old favs. I was glad to see Rene Russo as Frigga. Loki, of course and the Strike Team leader Rumlow.I'm sure this movie will make a ton of money. Most Marvel films do. I usually see each of the films in theaters more than once. Not this time. I'm done. I will not give any more of my hard earned cash to this effort. Not one penny more.

It is strange that you would miss an opportunity to have a batch of heroes killed in an epic battle, and instead srite them out the story with bad plotlines.The storyline was also a mess. The initial half hour or was it an hour before things got started could just have been cut down to five minutes, forgettable as it was. It was like the writers just gave up writing a meaningfull story from start to finish, and instead just had a main plotline patched together by coincidences (the bad guys randomly finding out what they heroes were doing), some side plots and then a big fight at the end.Even the selection of music was bad, there was hardly a scene with a really good song fitting a scene. This is something Marvel has been very good at, so it's strange they suddenly couldn't get that right.The point of the movie seems to reboot the MCU, removing a lot of characters because the actors playing them got too old for the roles - and maybe the writers had problems to create a story with a designated quota of heroes dying.

Seeing men in tights with big letters on their chests just doesn't do it for me.
But I do like Batman Begins as an example of some guy in tights still been a good film.. I like gritty and a little dark my super heros.
I liked some of the X-Men franchise. (I,II, Future Past..) These were sometimes intelligent and interesting.
Sadly to me the whole Avengers franchise has felt like a dumbed down version of the X-Men films..
It's basically a lot of ego centric stereotypes wise cracking at each other and showing off..Sadly that's what I got from watching this.
The first hour was terrible.
Spoilers potentially!
It gets better in the second half for a while.
The actors show some emotion! Wow.. some years are shed. The wooden acting still shines through however..
I mean I'm surprised at the high ratings for this film.
It seems like everyone a just forgiven the huge plot holes, poor acting and unnatural script writing and ultra predictable stereotypes .. and everything that's bland and wrong with this film... Because...
It cost a boat load of money? Has a lot of secrecy around the ending(s)?
I actually stopped watching with about 30 mins left.. after the big battle where everyone is thrown together to fight off this guy who by that time we don't even care what happens to him anymore anyway.. it's all just a big mess if you ask me.
I really don't get it.
So many plot holes and WTF moments?
It's just all so wooden..
Like Guardians of the Galaxy but less funny, fun or relatable.
The CGI was disappointing. The hulk character had no life in him.. and neither did the actors sadly.

The comparison is unfavorable, partly because GoT continues it very rushed approach to writing, but mainly because Endgame does it very well. The detail of the plotting is of course filled with holes that are best just to ignore, but the structure allows for a very nice conclusion as we retouch on moments from within the existing films, allowing nostalgia, references, and a sense of winding it up (although of course it will continue as long as the films make money). As with Infinity War, the writing somehow gives characters enough time despite there being so many of them; it hits several tones but none undercuts or takes away from another; and it mixes humor and action into a plot that takes itself seriously enough so it feels like it has weight.Of course it is still a blockbuster film, and far from perfect, but it is impressively done and very easy to enjoy if you go with what it is doing.","[['Infinity War', 'a little bit', 'the hype', 'Reddit'], ['the overall picture', 'Infinity War', 'a blockbuster', 'pure', 'simple', 'a piece', 'work', 'that structure', 'time', 'the final season', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'the way', 'everything'], ['The comparison', 'GoT', 'approach', 'writing', 'Endgame'], ['The detail', 'the plotting', 'course', 'the structure', 'nice conclusion', 'nostalgia', 'a sense', 'course', 'money'], ['Infinity War', 'somehow', 'enough time', 'none', 'humor', 'action', 'a plot', 'course', 'a blockbuster', 'film']]","[['Infinity War', 'little bit', 'hype', 'Reddit', 'many popular posts', 'Avengers films'], ['overall picture', 'Infinity War', 'blockbuster pure', 'simple', 'piece of work', 'terms', 'is.In terms', 'structure', 'time', 'few comments', 'season of Game', 'Thrones', 'episodes', 'way', 'everything'], ['comparison', 'GoT', 'approach', 'writing', 'Endgame'], ['detail', 'plotting', 'course', 'holes', 'structure', 'nice conclusion', 'moments', 'films', 'nostalgia', 'references', 'sense', 'course', 'films', 'money'], ['Infinity War', 'somehow', 'characters', 'enough time', 'several tones', 'none undercuts', 'humor and action', 'plot', 'course', 'blockbuster film']]"

You will have missed nothing.This movie was either way too long or just nowhere near long enough. This was supposed to be a part II of conclusion that wraps up an entire universe of characters spanning 20 movies and they couldn't be arsed to give us a third act?Unfortunately, they titled the movie Avengers: Endgame, and making a sequel to that would be nearly as bad as having a movie titled Rambo: First Blood Part II. What would they have called a third movie? Avengers: The Really Real End Time, Place, Realm. (No, we honestly mean it this time.)Sadly, the first hour or so of the movie is Ant Man trying to save a tacked on, marketing driven first act that pays off in no way. Meanwhile, also tied to marketing, some major plot holes and omissions were completely egregious.A large portion of the principle photography for this movie was done alongside side Infinity Wars itself, which would've made sense if they'd had a coherent story line by then.Leave it to the screenwriters, they'll make something of it. Leave it to the editors, they'll fix it in post. Well, somebody forgot to fix it. And it wasn't me. Fortunately, marketing fixes everything.Let's face it, there are two kinds of people in this world: those who for a final movie who are just going to love it no matter what, those who view the movie with the same critical eye they would the others, and those who decide that there can only be two types of people.Why are there always two kinds of people? Look at Loki! Now that's an interesting character. He can be good; he can be bad. He's fiendish and lovable. He's a hero and a villain and an anti-hero and-still, somehow-human, god, and ice thing.Honestly, Infinity Wars couldn't have come at a worse time.

108,Avengers: Endgame,Trivial. Silly. Predictable.,"Three words to describe the methodology inherent in destroying a franchise - or any story for that matter. For all the intrigue, conjecture, speculation, and cosmic potential Endgame enjoyed long before its release - and might have included - they opted for the least fascinating and pedestrian of stories: when it all else fails, just go back in time and change it! I do not mind heavy CGI movies with no substance; they're entertaining from a technical perspective, and when a decent story props it up, at least there exists some satisfaction. That said, with Infinity War, there was great possibility. I'm not going to bother with a detailed review here ... this movie was wrong ... all those richly detailed characters, all those amazing back stories, all that simmering creativity, all that ingenuity and inspiration totally and utterly wasted.

130,Avengers: Endgame,A bad way to end a spectacular franchise,"I never did side with either DC or Marvel - even as a kid in the 1960's. There were superheroes I liked and ignored the rest. Now, while DC is showing us how poorly a film can be made (particularly ""Justice League""), Marvel has aced 60% of their 22 films to date in my opinion. I wish that was the case with this one. It not only underwhelmed me, it didn't serve it's predecessor well.I certainly don't fault the cast because outside the handful of main characters, the rest were merely background and foreground. After Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Hulk, Hawkeye and Black Widow, the rest of the cast were so many that they seemed like they were there for scenery. And like ""Justice League"", ""Avengers: Endgame"" suffered from the ""more is more"" syndrome that may please the under-10 crowd, but takes meaning away for us older viewers.Let's not overlook the cop-out remedy in science fiction these days - the reliance upon time travel to get out of a script jam. I realize it was a necessity in this particular chain of fictional events, but after a while it seems like (pardon the musical reference) a long, drawn-out guitar solo that has you wishing the band would get back to the song.This review isn't due to Thor (my favorite Marvel hero) growing fat and channeling his inner surfer dude, Tony Stark losing his life or Gamora 2.0 being the anti-Gamora. My regret is FOR the franchise instead of me as a viewer. They ended on a sad technical note due to unnecessary goings-on that I'm sure they worked very hard at trying to tie up in a movie.Another point that detracted from this film, and a few others in the Marvel cinematic universe is their social messaging. They didn't need to preach woman power because superheroes already have that built into their character. Here, it's shoved into our faces to signal their fashionable virtuosity. In other words, if there is a female superhero in a film, I don't need to be reminded that there's a sexual revolution going on here in reality. Theirs are formidable personas without need to be underscored.Using another musical analogy, this movie was like the members of Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and The Who taking the stage at the same time and playing their sets. Apart, they're the best. Together, they're just noise. ""Avengers: Endgame"" would have been better if they pared down the scope, although I understand why they went the way they did. A franchise as successful as MCU set itself up for such a debacle. I'm grateful that it wasn't much, much worse.I thank those at Marvel for bringing to life the characters I read about in comic books at the corner store.

He's also named after the Greek god of death you stupid idiots all he wants to do is kill people literally. In this movie, however; and in infinity war Thanos is a big ugly bald crybaby and only wants to kill half the universe because he thinks that will stop overpopulation or some nonsense which it won't permanently the population will just go back to what it was eventually he solved nothing if he wanted to stop overpopulation he should have killed 100% of the universe's population along with the annoying guardians of the galaxy.
And then they just do a back to the future and resurrect everyone which is stupid and cliché and meaningless because no one died, nothing of value happened, nothing had a lasting impact for more than a few months blah blah blah they killed iron man thankfully, since he wan't the iron man that Stan lee and jack Kirby created in the 60's he was just a shell of man pun not intended (in case you didn't know his nickname is ole' shell head) this Iron Man helped ruin the last Spiderman movie but he will likely help ruin the next one too along with help from all the bad writing.
Also, Thanos' costume looks bad I hate how they have to make all the superhero costumes look more realistic or really more like pretentious modern art with weird textures. But back to the movie, it looks like it has over used CGI all marvel movies are just big cartoons with real actors in the old cartoons from the 90's and early 2000's looked better and the action looked realistic within the universe rather than jarring.

They wanna pack it all in and in the end they get nothing, mixing it all up in a terrible way.

146,Avengers: Endgame,One of the Worst 8.5+ Reviewed movies on IMDB,"First of all - this movie had to be brilliant to back up all the hype and legacy from earlier films. So is it brilliant? No, it's not even close.Second of all - Endgame just isn't a very good movie in any noteworthy sense, outside of effects and really good action scenes. And this brings me back to my first point. Perhaps this formula would work during the rise of comic films, but I can't see this film as anything but a huge disappointment.After a brutally emotional opening scene, that I have to admit - is really good, Endgame then proceeds to jump from scene to scene with inconsistent tone, pace, and development. A serious movie can have great humor, but the way Endgame uses slapstick humor, and non-serious characters is, well - silly. Is this a serious movie or not? Many of the films rules or conventions are openly broken to serve secondary storylines, and much of the 'science' is just plain dumb. I can suspend disbelief and get into stylized movies, but so much of this movie just comes off shallow and not really well thought out.This includes the story arc that to me has little natural flow. Many comic movies today seem to come off more as bad, incomplete TV episodes that rely on being part of a series for relevance. Movies should never be like that, and Endgame felt to me like three TV episodes jammed together, with three to five tac-on false endings.While I really liked many of the action scenes, which are clearly well conceived and beautiful to watch - at this point action scenes should be a given, and the story should have the same excellence. I don't feel like I'm being to picky when great movies in the Marvel universe exist (Dr. Strange for instance). I don't consider Infinity War one of them, but it's a heck of a lot better than Endgame.To me, outside of the opening scene, all the emotional moments fall absolutely flat. Considering the conclusion of Infinity War - there is a blatantly obvious sequence that should exude the epitome of joy.

147,Avengers: Endgame,Time travel is when you run out of ideas or cant write worth a darn,"As the title says. You know you have reached a dead end when you introduce time travel to resolve things. It works fine in shows that focus on it like Quantum Leap or Sliders but its usually a sign that you cant write worth a darn if you bring it into something else. That and alternate universes etc. They have been done to death and back and are just a plot device to overcome bad writing.So anyway, I still gave this a 5 because the CGI and fight scenes were fun. Unfortunately, that is about all there is to say about this movie. It was pretty hollow. The only source of comedy came with the introduction of smart hulk who was just funny conceptually more than anything else.

156,Avengers: Endgame,One Of the WORST mcu movie after Ant-Man,"People won't agree with me because they are blinded by the hype and grandeur of the movie and the way it has been marketed. But this is one movie that has dozen of flaws, stupidity and unnecessary forced humour scenes.
1. How on earth did Tony figure out time-travel is possible and perfectly safe in just a night, without any failures. Just for the sake of argument, he had help from Ant-man(which isn't shown in the movie), but let's just assume it, why a mind like Tony, the smartest on earth didn't figure it out earlier, why the avengers didn't even discuss time travel earlier during those 5 years ?2. Captain Marvel has disappeared from the entire movie, honestly Rocket had x3 times more screen appearance than the strongest marvel character. The avengers don't even speak her name or call out for help when going back in time to collect the stones. The director didn't even talk about it so the people watching it completely forget about her. And then she suddenly appears in the end scene.3. The entire plot is very mediocre, quite stupid and hastily made.4. Why o why did you ruin Thor, what was the reason behind it ? Don't tell me that he was depressed and defeated so he became a like ginger. Because 5 years of beer drinking and getting fat and all it took was 5 minutes of absolutely no convincing to get back into the game. Highly stupid and unnecessary.6. So much of time and effort and some amazing scenes are put into Infinity war to get Thor his new axe. And now the hammer is suddenly just back. Because the present Thor goes back to past and just takes the hammer and returns back. So what does the past Thor uses now ? And why put so much effort to create an awesome axe when you again brought back hammer. Absolutely no sense.8. A very minute but noticeable point. Apparently normal humans(clint and natasha) can breathe on the other planets without any issues, they all have same atmosphere and gravity like earth. For someone who is a fan of space and galaxy genre, finds it really stupid.9. When you go back and take infinity stones , and disturb that past reality it creates problems, okay that's standard time travel issue, so the solution is to put back infinity stones and everything is good. That's fine.
But the hammer was taken from the past Thor and wasn't returned. But no body cares about that. Apparently magically a new hammer will appear on its own somehow. From such a large scale franchise, one of the ugliest time travel stuff.
I can go on and on and on about the bad points in the movie because it has no end.
The emotional content of the movie is pretty good, especially the scenes involving Tony, pepper and spiderman.
Yes there are mistakes in every movie. But one can't expect such stupid stuff from Endgame. The largest movie ever in past two decades after having a runtime of over 180 minutes.

At the start, or should I say for the first 30 min all the characters are depressed and feeling sorry for themselves. Then they mention time travel, yes time travel. I mean after all Marvels great films and ideas the best they could come up with to get things back to normal was time travel. What next, Ironman (Robert Downey Jr) wakes up back in Ironman 1 and the last 20 years have all been a dream aka Dallas style. Come on give me a break the best they could come up with was time travel. Anyway 1 1/2 hours into the film I turned to my friend and said the last 1 1/2 hours must be amazing as this has been so boring and all the reviews say this is a great movie. To my disappointment it did not get much better. In the 3 hours of running time there is at a push 30 minutes of action and that is at a push.

We are entering the get woke, go broke phase of the MCUNow onto the movie:The plot line is all over the place and they made the mistake of using time travel to fix the universes problems, there are no consequences for failure anymore in the mcu, because just like in Dragon all we can just ""Wish back"" all those who died. Its basically Back To The Future, the Thanos edition.Once again, they sideline Thor and The Hulk by using them purely as a punchline for lame, low IQ jokes in a corny script that feels like it is trying to be so many things, but doesn't quite hit the mark. Thor spends the entire movie as a whiny, fat child with mommy issuesAlthough there were some very nice, touching moments to the movie I feel like most of the mourning and brooding could have been condensed into a montage in order for us to see the heroes do, exactly what we came to see the heroes do, fight bad guys. There's very little in the way of action and because the story was so all over the place, I left feeling like nothing was actually accomplished in this movie.As always Tony is amazing, throwing out one liners and nicknames and Captain America is great too.Overall I really enjoyed many aspects of it, but at the same time I felt like there was no control over the plot.

We got those answer by a stunning, realistic, dramatic starting scene.However, devolopment phase of the movie is a SCANDAL. Too many boring staff going on, trying to find a solution for the making the world nice again (I should say that post apocalyptic scenes are really illogical, people still sorrow after 5 years later and there is nothing going on the world except japan mafia. LOL) and they come up with a idea of TIME MACHINE.Top level of creativity showed itself around here. Thanks to script writers nice job!Two geniuses, Mark Ruffalo and Robert D.

207,Avengers: Endgame,The reason for film/TV to stay out of time travel.,"I have watched movies and rated them 1/10 without writing a review. But Avengers: Engame build up so much momentum with Infinity War and all that PR upfront, positioning A:E as the ultimate finally of the MCU that the failing of the movie is ultimately that - the sad finally of the MCU.Cinematography: Well done, good CGI as in previous films. Some scenes were shot to dramatic for the actual content of that scene but that's pathos (not a relative of Thanos) in American cinema. Some surprise moments that would are shot perfectly highlighting them (Captain America).Storyline:
*If you don't mind spending the ticket money please watch the movie and decide for yourself.*
Time Travel is a tricky concept with different approaches but there are some theories established and they simply make certain developments during or after time travel impossible / illogical. At this point, I can get behind Stark figuring out time travel with Quantum mechanics. After that the problems for that movie start...A) Illogic of time travel:
The group enables Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos to follow them into the 5 year future where he tries to grab all stones at once. This Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos gets killed in the future which makes it impossible and illogical for all the things happening from the time that Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos left his timeline, e.g. the Infinity War movie and all this Thanos did in his quest for the stones.
If Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos leaves his time (past) into the future and no Infinity War happens, Starks Timeline with a daughter also would not happen. Nevertheless, she keeps on existing after Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos is killed in the future. Zero logic.B) The handling of the stones:
Thanos has his gauntlet specially made in Nidavellir with the power of a star as all stones together hold all of reality. Now all it takes is Stark and some nano-tech to handle them and channel their power? Not realistic by the logic of the MCU explained before.
B.a.) For Ronan (Guardians I) it was almost impossible to wield one infinity stone and the Guardians barely and only survived by splitting the energy between them. The Hulk is almost killed but survives because it's Gamma Ray- okay. But that Stark simply can put on all stones and is not instantly ripped apart makes all previous told content irrelevant and makes this facet of the MCU ridiculous. It's a story line decision to kill of Stark for dramatic reasons but there would have been much better, logical ways. Other characters like a god (Thor) could have handled the stones by the unrealistic Iron Man gauntlet adopting to the persons hand.Over all, a white board, pen and a few hours would have shown the writers where the illogic happens and how to make it right in the sense of simple reasonable logic. This however is an unworthy end to the MCU and previous film.","[['a review'], ['Engame', 'much momentum', 'Infinity War', 'PR', 'upfront', 'E', 'MCU', 'the failing', 'the movie', 'the MCU.Cinematography', 'Well', 'CGI'], ['the actual content', 'that scene', 'pathos', 'a relative', 'Thanos', 'American cinema'], ['Some surprise', 'Captain America', '.Storyline', '*', 'the ticket', 'money', 'please', 'the movie'], ['Time Travel', 'a tricky concept', 'time', 'travel', 'impossible / illogical'], ['this point', 'Stark', 'time', 'travel', 'Quantum'], ['that movie', 'start', 'Illogic', 'time', 'travel', 'The group', 'Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos', 'year', 'future'], ['the future', 'the time', 'Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos', 'timeline', 'e.g'], ['Infinity War', 'movie', 'Thanos', 'quest'], ['time', 'the future', 'Infinity War', 'Starks Timeline', 'a daughter'], ['Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos', 'the future'], ['Zero', 'logic.B', 'The handling', 'gauntlet', 'Nidavellir', 'the power', 'a star', 'reality'], ['Stark', 'power'], ['the logic', 'MCU'], ['B.a'], ['Ronan', 'Guardians', 'infinity', 'stone', 'Guardians', 'the energy'], ['Hulk', 'Gamma Ray-', 'okay'], ['Stark', 'this facet', 'MCU'], ['a story', 'line', 'decision', 'Stark'], ['a god', 'Thor', 'Iron Man', 'gauntlet', 'a white board', 'the illogic', 'the sense', 'simple reasonable logic'], ['an unworthy end', 'MCU', 'previous film']]","[['movies', 'review'], ['Avengers', 'Engame', 'momentum with Infinity War', 'PR upfront', 'E', 'MCU', 'failing', 'movie', 'MCU.Cinematography', 'Well', 'good CGI', 'previous films'], ['scenes', 'actual content', 'scene', 'pathos', 'relative of Thanos', 'American cinema'], ['surprise moments', 'Captain America', '.Storyline', '*', 'ticket money please', 'movie'], ['Time Travel', 'tricky concept', 'different approaches', 'theories', 'certain developments', 'time travel', 'impossible / illogical'], ['point', 'Stark', 'time travel', 'Quantum mechanics'], ['problems', 'movie start', 'Illogic of time travel', 'group', 'Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos', 'year future', 'stones'], ['future', 'things', 'time that Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos', 'timeline', 'e.g'], ['Infinity War movie', 'Thanos', 'quest', 'stones'], ['time', 'future', 'Infinity War', 'Starks Timeline', 'daughter'], ['Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos', 'future'], ['Zero logic.B', 'handling', 'stones', 'gauntlet', 'Nidavellir', 'power', 'star', 'stones', 'reality'], ['Stark', 'power'], ['logic', 'MCU'], ['B.a'], ['Ronan', 'Guardians', 'infinity stone', 'Guardians', 'energy'], ['Hulk', 'Gamma Ray- okay'], ['Stark', 'stones', 'facet', 'MCU'], ['story line decision', 'Stark', 'dramatic reasons', 'logical ways'], ['Other characters', 'god', 'Thor', 'stones', 'Iron Man gauntlet', 'persons', 'white board', 'few hours', 'writers', 'illogic', 'sense', 'simple reasonable logic'], ['unworthy end', 'MCU', 'previous film']]"

209,Avengers: Endgame,LOOK AT FAT BUMBLING THOR AND LAUGH and ignore the plot holes pls,"I realise that I'm in the minority, here, but I walked out of this...this thing really, really angry. Oh, it's a spectacle, to be sure, but an empty one. To each their own, and more power to you if you enjoyed the film, but I couldn't. Why? A number of reasons. It'll be wordy, but at least you can see why exactly I only gave it a three-star-rating - and this is coming from a person who mostly reviews things she loves.
Anyway, here goes.
First, characterisation. Oh, boy. Let's start with a spiteful nit-pick. Those kept piling up, which is why I mention it. The Asgardians. I have a question, writers: why are the Asgardians fishermen now? Seriously, what gives? Asgard was a highly developed society with technology so advanced, it looked like magic. They had Star-Trek-esque power shields. They had hovercraft. They are not fishermen. Is that because of Norway? Not everyone fishes there, either and also, Asgardians are not Norwegians. It's like if you live close to a river and you specialise in engineering energy shields, someone suddenly pushes you into a boat, and goes: ""Fish!!!!"" Sorry, but no.
Then, there's the real problem: Fat Bumbling Thor. What was that? No, seriously. What was that? That's not Thor. That drunken, stoned, lardy, snickering, obnoxious fool is not Thor. Remember the first movie? Where he was a bit of an impulsive, boisterous tool but still overall noble, courageous, selfless, and cultured? The Thor who created some situational comedy without turning into a pitiable punchline? That's Thor.
Character derailment for the sake of komedy is not funny, nor is it excusable. It's just bad writing. It's gimmicky and I hate it.
Don't even get me started on how Nebula kills her past self without consequences or how years of character development for Gamora get wiped away. Awesome, that. Top notch.
The other characters don't fare all that well, either. What was it with Tony suddenly being ""tired and finally ready to rest"" or whatever (paraphrasing, here)? Since when? And Steve staying in the past and playing houseboy whilst Hydra run rampant and his best buddy gets tortured is maybe the worst bit of pathetic ""happy ending"" I've ever come across with. That's not something he would do. If he had a shot at saving Bucky in the past, he would. He wouldn't be this selfish. I also wonder how exactly that worked in everyday life. What did he do all day? The dishes? Peggy's life would be drastically different with Steve around. None of the future events would have happened, and there is simply no handwaving this away or ignoring it. The reason I'm harping on all these details is that added together, they just don't make sense. Everything is just off, and we're supposed to just go along with it like it doesn't reek of sloppily put-together, bad fanfiction? No. No, thanks. I'll pass.
That's all bad enough, but then, the plot kicks in, and boy howdy, is it a doozy. Now, I realise that time travel stories need to be taken with a healthy heap of salt (pun unintentional but fitting), yes, but I guess it's the entire package that made me so mad. It's the cavalier attitude, the nonsense, the lack of intelligence, the lack of logic, and all the la-dee-dah accompanying it. First of all, there's the ""oh, it's not like in Terminator and Star Trek"". What is it like, then? If I travel into the past, it's my future? Okay, so riddle me this: if someone goes to the past and kills their past self, then they're still dead in the future and will, therefore, never travel into the past. That's a head-scratcher, but how does the movie deal with it? TERMINATOR WAS WRONG!!!!!! HEY, LOOK, SHINY CARKEYS!!!! That's pretty much it. It doesn't make sense on even the most basic level. Even on first viewing, when we're supposed to just cackle at Fat Bumbling Thor and gawp at the big explosions, the whole plot simply falls apart. Cause and effect are a thing. If someone cuts off my finger in 1999, I'll still be Frodo in 2019. You can't just go THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS, make a wannabe-snarky quip, and then movie on to the next hilarious hijinks. What outrageous thing will Fat Bumbling Thor do next? How much more amusing will this light-hearted version of the Hulk be (never mind how all his problems just got magically solved for the sake of hurr-hurr-funny).
And how exactly did Steve get the MacGuffins back to the exact same moment in time? That's just virtually impossible, because there were always people around. Take the glowstick of destiny, for instance. Hail Hydra? Okay, so that means that Winter Soldier etc. didn't happen. Nothing past those movies happened, because how - how - did Steve get that thing back without anyone seeing him? There were people around at all times (even Howard Stark in the 1970s). How did he get the ether back to Jane? Did he sneak up on her? Even if, she would have noticed, and that would have changed everything. What about Natasha? How did that pan out? The lol-I-kill-me-first scene, and then Steve shows up and it's all hunky-dory? Why is she still dead? If it never happened, then she shouldn't be dead. But I guess the movie told me her death is final, so it's all good. Tell me, movie, don't show. I don't need sense or logic. It was in the script, so it must be true. And what about Loki? Not only did he (as per the rules of the movie) create an alternate timeline by stealing the Tesseract, but he's gone now from the main one, isn't he? And none of these taking-away-bringing-back gigs affected the other events occurring simultaneously in the MCU timeline? How?
The scenes went on for too long, too, especially the ""comedic"" ones. The one relatively in the beginning, with Scott and Bruce and those kids...yikes. It went on forever. The joke wasn't that clever or amusing in the first place, and it overstayed its welcome like nobody's business. And they kept doing that over and over (o hai Fat Bumbling Thor).
Sigh.
The problem is that all these logic failings, the bad characterisation, and the shucks-ain't-we-clever-thinking-is-for-dopes instants pile up. The movie feels like a clip show: a bunch of komedy or action sketches sewn together, written by folks who think their audience has the attention span of a tomato. That's the worst part. The lack of effort to tell a coherent story. Oh, I'm sorry, was I supposed to feel sad when Tony bit it? Because I didn't care.
It just made me angry.
I'm only giving it three stars because the effects were shiny and it's not the actors' fault.","[['the minority', 'this thing'], ['a spectacle'], ['power', 'the film'], [], ['A number'], ['a person'],

210,Avengers: Endgame,Just another overhyped MCU tribute to Fans.,"This is a good movie in terms of all its technical background but there is a lack of feel and energy throughout the film except for the scenes towards the end. You just needs to sit and wait patiently for the final battle.

211,Avengers: Endgame,Illogical and Convoluted,"This is by far the worst MCU movie I've ever seen. Ever.I was looking forward to it after last year's Infinity War, to see how they would bounce back from that Thanos snap. But boy, was I disappointed. The whole ""time heist"" plot is tortuously senseless, it lacks any form of intelligence from any aspect, be it scientific or imaginative. What kind of ""writers"" are responsible for this? Or what were they on while ""writing"" this? The quick one-liners, barbs and quips are cringe-worthy and so are the ""comedic"" situations.One can objectively agree that the movie is way too long and boring for the first two hours, even my 11 yo super-fan brother thought so. It offers very little entertainment. The plot is too incoherent for any sensible adults and very complex to follow for the young ones so they just eagerly await the battle finale. Which does arrive at the end in the form of a badly choreographed CGI bukake scene with pyrotechnics and many, many cuts for anyone to follow what the heck is going on.Massive, glaring plot-holes abound from start to finish which I bet are invisible to the throngs of fanboys all over the world over-hyping and claiming this piece of hot, leaky garbage to be the greatest movie ever made. Along with giving it over the top reviews and ratings.Can't believe this is what sells to the masses and makes studios billions of dollars now. Makes me lose all hope in future superhero movies.

213,Avengers: Endgame,10% CGI Action 75% Talking about stuff 5% Actually funny jokes and 10% Serious cringe,"We are up to number... 15?? 20?? Whatever... in Disney's desperate attempts to wring every last cent out of what at the time was a clever new take on super hero movies with Iron Man. So I shouldn't be surprised that the writers and editors are phoning it in by now but it really shows.
I would suggest the writers get a copy of any of the top 100 books on screenwriting... any one at all... and read the very first lesson of any of those books, you know, the one where they say ""show don't tell"". I guarantee that we didn't need 80% of the movie to be exposition from the characters, especially in a superhero movie. I am sure the CGI team, you know, the people who take up most of the credits, could have fired up the Unreal Engine and pumped out a few more video game cut scenes to fill us in.
But I shouldn't blame this all on the writers, the editors pretty much looked at all of the footage, every last scrap of boring exposition and said ""whatever, just chuck it all in"". My girlfriend actually skipped a minute of dialogue at one point and it made no difference at all.
I would complain about the obvious cringe, especially during that lame scene at the end but so many of Marvel (property of the Mouse) fans probably see that cringe as a positive aspect. Whatever, it's hard to find a movie with less cringe nowadays, so it's to be expected.
There were a couple of great laugh out loud jokes and fat Thor was great, not to mention the Thor/Starlord dialogue.
But I can't recommend sitting through 2.5 hours of exposition and awkward CGI for the few brilliant moments.

229,Avengers: Endgame,**SPOILERS** Avengers: The Last Jedi,"""It wasn't as good as Infinity War."" That was all I could say as I stumbled home after two in the morning. It's taken some time, but I'm starting to understand why.The biggest problem I had with this film was how all the superheroes seemed to act as if ""The Snap"" happened only to them and no one else. The entire first act shows the cast depressed because they lost, and because of who they lost among their group. While this is understandable, it seems to be the only thing they care about. They only want to avenge the loss of their own loved ones, not the horror suffered by the rest of Earth.This isn't just my interpretation of the writing - the effect on the rest of humanity is almost completely hidden from view. As to the larger global cataclysm, we only get a few glimpses - Hawkeye's family, a memorial in San Francisco, a few people who show up to Captain America's grief counseling group. Other than that, we're merely told about the larger effects of that moment, such as when Black Widow states the Earth's governments are in ruins. It too well concealed the terror suffered by so many others on Earth, as if the writers themselves weren't sure how to convey the magnitude of the act.At the same time, the film assumes the surviving humans all know that Thanos and the Infinity Gauntlet were the reason behind half of the world disappearing. This raised several questions:First - how would they know that? Was humanity ever told that Thanos would wipe out half of existence if The Avengers failed? Do they even know what the Infinity Gauntlet is? Who would've been there to see it when it happened outside Wakanda's secluded African community? When people saw others turn to dust, wouldn't they think it was terrorism, a plague, or something entirely different?Second, if they were told, who did it? How did everyone react when they heard? And wouldn't they be upset at The Avengers for failing to stop Thanos? Why, five years later, would some kids walk up to The Hulk and take a selfie with him as if nothing had happened? You'd think our heroes would have been chased into hiding, not hanging out in their perfectly functioning headquarters to quip at each other.Much like ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and the Anime ""Sword Art Online,"" ""Endgame"" relies on a sudden jump forward in time to avoid answering these and other compelling questions. It is in the five years after ""The Snap"" that we could have learned more about humanity's response to the disaster, and how if at all The Avengers were blamed. After all, we know from the very beginning of the MCU, when Tony Stark reveals his secret identity, that humans know superheroes exist. It's these interactions between humans and the heroes that have driven much of the narrative in the MCU.But instead, at this most critical time, we're simply moved ahead to a moment of tenuous calm, thus allowing the Marvel brand of humor to continue despite the unfathomable tragedy. To the film's detriment, this isn't the most interesting time for the story to take place. And to make it worse, humanity has absolutely no role in shaping the narrative of the story. We're not even certain everyone comes back after The Avengers craft a gauntlet of their own - it's all done symbolically, without any of the emotion or consequence.As if gripped by the same depression of the film's characters, we're then thrown head-long into a ridiculous time travel plot that fills the film's second half. Thanks to the film's greatest hero - a rat - Ant-Man returns from out of nowhere, and while stuck in the Quantum Realm also seems to suddenly understand everything about time travel despite being a common thief. Tony Stark's concept of building a time machine also comes to him from out of nowhere. It would've been interesting to see this plan be an act of desperation by brutally depressed characters, all of them knowing the act is impossible, but just looking for something to do.But, of course, it works, and the film then partakes in its true passion - celebrating the MCU itself. Like a terrible clip show from a long-running show, much of what follows is everything you've already seen from nearly two dozen films, re-enacted all over again. It's quaint for hardcore fans of the series, but for me, it left me wondering if something more interesting could've been done in its place. The film can't even escape making the same mistake so many other films do by couching their time-travel plan in terms of still other movies, like ""Back To The Future"" and even ""Hot Tub Time Machine.""The inevitable over-indulgent fight signals the end of the film, featuring a chorus line of all the characters coming back as if preparing to take a final bow. It's the big applause moment of the film, but somehow still comes off rushed. We don't get any understanding of what it was like when each of them came back, and what effect it had on their loved ones left behind. We don't understand - other than a few lines from Spider-Man - what it felt like to be one of the murdered from Infinity War. It's at this moment you realize why they didn't show anyone else come back after the second ""Snap"" - once again, humanity took a back seat to allow the superheroes a dramatic entrance. But, for a three-hour film, it really lacked the weight the writers were clearly going for.In the fight itself, we're treated to many absurdities. The maligned Captain Marvel, who after nearly ending the film all by herself in the first five minutes literally told the audience ""you're not going to see me for a while,"" shoots in from out of nowhere and effortlessly destroys a ship, just as she had in her own film. She then joins a group of female superheroes who pointlessly pose for a moment, then unlike the male characters screaming and attacking, choose to scream and attack. On top of this ""Force Is Female"" crap, the whole sequence is shot like a DC fight scene, complete with an ugly brown filter over the colorful characters. But, hey, when it's all over, Thanos gets to die a second time.To round things off, the film follows ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" in gleefully letting the past die. While Iron Man gets an epic and dignified death - unwillingly, having started a family of his own - others aren't so fortunate. Captain America voluntarily becomes old, handing over his shield to his black friend Falcon. More wokeness ensues when Thor, transformed by depression into ""The Big Lebowski,"" hands over the keys to his sad little village to the Valkyrie woman from ""Ragnarok"" who can't act. One after the other, your favorite superheroes survive their greatest challenge only to voluntarily give up the reigns to a group far less interesting or talented. Then the actors sign their names ""Star Trek"" style, you wait 11 minutes for no after credits sequence, and its finally time to go pee.Once again, even in this biggest and most anticipated superhero film, this is yet another example of writers not taking the time to play with an idea and make their story the very best it could be. It's not a terrible film, but it's not a complete one, either. Tragically caught between racial and sexual politics, rabid fans, and Disney corporate, it lets a little too much of the outside world water-down a good story.","[['Infinity War'], ['home', 'the

230,Avengers: Endgame,I want three hours of my life back!!!,"I seriously don't get all the high ratings on this film!! The first hour was a total boring snooze fest (it was like being at a wake). Then there are the logic problems in the movie:
1) Time travel- the movie tells us that they can't go back in time and kill Thanos because that would 'violate the time laws' okay but they can go back and steel the stones, fight with their past selves, and interact with their dead parents???
2) the society can build a well manicured monument complete with granite engraved names of the missing but CAN'T pick up the garbage all over the streets???
3) Okay half the people are gone but why are the scenes full of EMPTY streets?? You'll still have people in the cites just half as many. So NYC would go from 1 million plus to 500,000 plus. ect.Anyways for me it was not well written, the acting was flat, and the action was missing. I think Infinity War was 10x better.","[['this film'], ['The first hour', 'a total boring', 'snooze', 'a wake'], ['the movie', 'Time', 'the movie', 'time', 'Thanos', 'the time', 'steel', 'fight', 'interact'], ['the society', 'manicured monument', ""CA N'T"", 'the garbage'], ['Okay', 'EMPTY'], [], ['NYC', 'plus', 'plus'], ['the acting', 'the action'], ['Infinity War']]","[['high ratings', 'film'], ['first hour', 'boring snooze', 'wake'], ['logic problems', 'movie', 'Time', 'movie', 'time', 'Thanos', 'time laws', 'okay', 'steel', 'stones', 'fight', 'past selves', 'interact', 'dead parents'], ['society', 'manicured monument', 'names', ""CA N'T"", 'garbage', 'streets'], ['Okay', 'people', 'scenes', 'EMPTY streets'], ['people', 'cites'], ['NYC', 'plus', 'plus'], ['ect.Anyways', 'acting', 'action'], ['Infinity War']]"
231,Avengers: Endgame,Not for me,"Reading the reviews and overall rating, clearly there was an audience for this movie, but I wasn't part of it.For me it was way too long and had way too many characters. Each character apparently had to have at least one super hero jump landing. A very overused and tired device. And, each character had to have at least one Zoolander, blue steel stare to the camera, before any fighting started. As these moments took up about an hour of the filming time, perhaps that explains the long run time.Then the story negates any lasting impact from the previous movie. Everything from the previous battle is irrelevant, because we can just go back in time and fix it. So assumably when the studios want to cash in again, Thanos can build a time machine after Infinity War, find out what happened in Endgame, and go back and fix that outcome. Next movie, the avengers steal the time machine and create another fix. Then in about another two sequels or so, the whole battle can be fought out again in the old west, with Doc, Marty, and Spider-Man driving the delorean, after some funny scenes where Thor helps him get his licence.The best way I can comment on this movie, is that I went to see it in the cinema with a 24yo friend. About half way through, I looked at him and he was asleep. I considered waking him up, but realised that whatever he was dreaming about, it had to be better than the movie.","[['overall rating', 'an audience', 'this movie', 'part', 'it.For', 'way', 'way'], ['Each character', 'hero', 'jump', 'landing'], ['tired device'], ['each character', 'Zoolander', 'blue steel', 'stare', 'the camera', 'any fighting'], ['an hour', 'the filming', 'time', 'the long run', 'the story', 'any lasting impact', 'the previous movie'], ['Everything', 'the previous battle', 'time'], ['cash', 'Thanos', 'a time', 'machine', 'Infinity War', 'Endgame', 'that outcome'], ['Next movie', 'the time', 'machine', 'another fix'], ['the whole battle', 'the old west', 'Doc', 'Marty', 'Spider-Man', 'the delorean', 'Thor', 'licence.The', 'way', 'this movie', 'the cinema', 'friend'], ['half way'], ['whatever', 'the movie']]","[['reviews', 'overall rating', 'audience', 'movie', 'part of it.For', 'way', 'way', 'many characters'], ['character', 'hero jump landing'], ['tired device'], ['character', 'Zoolander', 'steel stare', 'camera', 'fighting'], ['moments', 'hour', 'filming time', 'long run', 'story', 'lasting impact', 'previous movie'], ['Everything', 'previous battle', 'time'], ['studios', 'cash', 'Thanos', 'time machine', 'Infinity War', 'Endgame', 'outcome'], ['Next movie', 'avengers', 'time machine', 'fix'], ['sequels', 'whole battle', 'old west', 'Doc', 'Marty', 'Spider-Man', 'delorean', 'funny scenes', 'Thor', 'licence.The', 'way', 'movie', 'cinema', 'friend'], ['way'], ['whatever', 'movie']]"

This was always going to be a film all about how the good guys could return to winning ways after getting their proverbial @as kicked in infinity war.
Yes we probably wanted to see some of the aftermath of half the universe being wiped out....but it didn't need to play out for so long.
To be honest I dislike most films when time travel becomes involved...I just think it all becomes a bit ""well nothing really matters as we'll just go back in time and change it"".
I've watched infinity war 8 times already... but i just can't imagine ever sitting through this that many times.
My honest opinion is it's too long....some of the main characters are just either disappointing or none existent.
Another issue..if you have a character as powerful as Captain Marvel the rest of the squad become a bit redundant...unless you a again decide to send her to the other side of the universe.
Some people will kid themselves that this is the peak of the whole journey.....its not...it already happened in infinity war.","[['Infinity War'], ['a film', 'proverbial @', 'infinity', 'war'], ['the aftermath'], ['time', 'travel', 'a bit', 'nothing', 'time', 'change'], ['infinity', 'war'], ['opinion', '....', 'none', 'existent'], ['Another issue', 'a character', 'Captain Marvel', 'the rest', 'the squad', 'a bit', 'decide', 'the other side', 'the universe'], ['the peak', 'the whole journey', 'infinity', 'war']]","[['Infinity War'], ['film', 'good guys', 'ways', 'proverbial @', 'infinity war'], ['aftermath', '....'], ['films', 'time travel becomes', 'bit', 'nothing', 'matters', 'time and change'], ['infinity war', 'times', 'many times'], ['opinion', 'long ....', 'main characters', 'none existent'], ['issue', 'character', 'Captain Marvel', 'rest', 'squad', 'bit', 'decide', 'other side', 'universe'], ['people', 'peak', 'whole journey', 'infinity war']]"
236,Avengers: Endgame,Weak,"Im a very critical movie watcher, so if you are not prepared for nitpicking than please understand my review might not be for you. I enjoyed the movie very much, now lets get to the juicy things I wish the movie had done instead. I know its a Disney movie but that doesn't stop me from wanting to see the most epic comic book movie in history if they changed a few things.1. Thanos never kills anyone(besides loki *maybe*) A. SOME people died in this movie (black widow, Iron Man) but they died from heroic sacrifice. Not from Thanos's power. B. I wanted to see Thanos kill Iron man, or Thor, or Any major character. After the movie 3-5 people should have been dead and your like, What now? But instead almost everyone is alive and you can already see the next movies coming out soon. C. In Infinty War Thanos was the biggest baddest guy in the universe, In this movie the avengers are fighting a new Thanos that isnt even that bad ass or cool or anything, thats why he should have killed someone on the battle field like Captain America. To show the strenght and might and danger of Thanos. I like Capstain America's happy ending, but I would have liked it even more if he died to Thanos and Hulk or Thor got revenge, which leads to point 2.2. Thor, Hulk, Capetian America, Iron man, Captain Marvel, or Someone should have killed Thanos in battle on the battle field. Imagine if Captain America died by Thanos hands, and HULK goes into a rage and kills Thanos. Then they take the glove off of his and and do the snap. Then Hulk would be a legend and that would be part of the history forever. Hulk Thanos killer, or Thor the Asgaurd god who killed Thanos. 2A. Instead legends like Thor and Hulk are reduced to side comic characters like the antler Gaurdian of the galaxy lady and rocket racoon. Thor even leaves at the end with the Racoon and Gaurdians, and seems to join their crew and set up for the next comedy action movie..... which is funny and great. But I would have preferred the fighter warrior Thor. The Thor that opened a sun onto himself to reforge his hammer. What the heck happened to the Thor who almost killed Thanos In Infinity war? why did we get this comedy relief fat Thor. Yes he is really funny. But I would have preferred him to fight toe to toe with Thanos, instead of make a few jokes. 2B. HULK got the same treatment as a comic/clown. He can kill Thanos. Hulk literally never got mad and angry and started smashing people. He never smashed Thanos or fought him at all in this movie.3. To many emotional scenes, Hawkeye walking his dog...etc. Tony Stark doing a pov youtube video documentary about if he wants to fight or not. These are the greatest fighters in history in the greatest fight against their greatest enemy. Show some more fight scenes. Show some intensity and tension. They went back in time so easy and got the stones so easy as they are cracking jokes. Black widow soul gem scene was good, but they still needed some fight scenes. Someone should have died to retrieve one of the stones. or should have got stuck in time or something.4.Fake gauntlet. Why did Thanos go to the Asgard holy weapon site to make that gauntlet, the only thing that can hold the infinity stones, if iron man can just hold the stones on his robot arm. I thought the Gauntlet was special and magical. I dont like that scene at all. Why couldn't someone just kill Thanos and then they use the gauntlet to snap after they pull it off his dead hand. They wanted it to be more tense, but it just created a plot hole and just breaks the reality and power of the gauntlet and the stones and all of the lore.5. So my main gripe with the movie even though I enjoyed it for funs sake, was that no real consequences happened. Only Theoretical consequences people sacrificing themselves for the greater good etc boring storyline. I wanted Thanos the biggest bad guy in comic books, to have done something of weight. In the end he did nothing. He should have killed Iron man. He should have killed Captain America or Thor, or Scarlett witch or all three of them. His plan got completely foiled and he personally did no damage. weak. Thanos is weak, he couldn't kill one measly earth defender.6, Captain marvel flying around for no reason doing no damage, weak.Infinity war had more tension, more fights, and more deaths in battle. I am highly disappointed from this great movie.

242,Avengers: Endgame,Avengers: Endgame,"11 years, and 22 movies all lead to this point. This movie was a truly amazing cinematic experience. It had everything a Marvel fan like me needed for the end of a saga. Sure, this wasn't the best MCU movie ever made, but it is definitely in the top 5. Marvel did what they needed to do to please their fans and end a saga 11 years in the making. That included going back in time to older movies, having cameos from past characters, and having a battle at the end that would give a satisfying conclusion to the Infinity Saga. Another thing this movie did good was the plot. I actually liked the fact that they had to go back in time to the old movies and retrieve the Infinity Stones when they appeared throughout the saga. I also loved the final battle. It was the perfect way to end the saga. It was also not short on time. The times from when the battle started to when the battle ended was around 45ish minutes. It was perfect. The way they ended to story at the end was also amazing and somewhat emotional. Marvel obviously isn't done making movies or shows, but they did need to end the story somehow, and I won't spoil how they did it.In the end, this movie was a perfect way to end the Infinity Saga. I would recommend watching this movie, but everyone basically has already seen it.

246,Avengers: Endgame,Not a patch on it's predecessor,"Infinity War is possibly one of the greatest movies there ever was. It has superheroes, comedy and suspense in spades and has you on the edge of your seat for two and a half hours. If you're not laughing you are biting your fingernails.Endgame is not half the film of its predecessor. It could have been a masterpiece if the writers had only continued the same formula. Instead they turned it into something resembling an Ironman and Captain America tribute.One of the most appealing things about Infinity War was that all of the heroes had major parts, had amusing lines and were in situations that made you care about them. Endgame features appearances of about 1 minute for the majority of the Avengers except Ironman, Captain America, Antman and Hawkeye. Even Thor who had a lot of screentime is diminished and for no particular reason. I mean, this god nearly killed Thanos, yet in the next movie is reduced to a comedy sideshow?In all honesty the movie feels rushed, it's like they had a timeline to get it finished and went with the script that was the best of a poor bunch. I mean, what was the point of Captain Marvel and the major movie before? She featured for about 30 seconds in 3 hours. Infinity War insinuated she would have a major say in the outcome yet her screentime was barely worth a credit which was the same for most of the other Avengers. In fact, why market this movie as Avengers at all?After all of the hype and the absolute triumph that is Infinity War, two and a half hours with little more than talking, then one fight scene resembling, but not a patch on, the Wakanda fight does not give this movie a right to a good rating. MCU phase 3 should have finished with Infinity War, on a high at the end of a rollercoaster with questions that need to be answered.

0,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,Sort of disappointed..,"I got to admit I wasn't particularly blown away by anything in the movie.. I might even say ""I was bored"" by it.Don't get me wrong.. it IS a spectacle! The action is great. The locations are nice, costume design, sound design, etc. But it is overall a soft release not worth seeing in theaters.. specially as a follow-up to what Endgame was.The biggest problem for me, is how the underwritten lead has muddled personality (for reasons covered in the story) devoid of charm, personality or good dialogue.The next issue is the humor, which didn't land for me.. Not once. The supporting lead Awkwafina isn't her normal ""loud"" self that's supposed to be funny every time she opens her mouth. Her role is very supportive and a little dramatic. And while I questioned myself why was she even there for, it doesn't ultimately matter. She is another forgettable character that is given more importance than the role deserves.Finally, the third act is weak. There's a balancing problem with stakes. You can't feel tension or weight to any action. And there's a lot of superficial ""I can't do it"" until they can.In the end, this feels like a very safe plot, written in a way to appeal to china (considering how the Mandarin is portrayed), that ends up appealing to no one specific. Certainly doesn't feel like a Marvel movie.. but it was bound to happen if we are to be introduced to different aspects of the narrative. But it also doesn't feel like a comic book.

1,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,Questionable script (and Awkwafina is just the worst),"The characters are a bit incoherent and straight up contradict their own characterizations at times, because the plot needs them to do it.

3,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Superhero.","Martial arts meets the MCU in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. More Crouching Tiger than Jackie Chan, the plot for the film is kinda hum-drum, the sort of mystical Eastern fantasy cobblers that practically writes itself.Shang-Chi is the son of immortal, power-hungry warlord Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) and Li (Fala Chen), a warrior woman from the hidden village of Ta Lo. After falling in love with Li and becoming a father, Wenwu gives up his wicked ways and packs away the ten legendary rings that gave him much of his power. However, after his wife is killed by his old enemies, Wenwu once again wears the rings and trains his son to become an assassin. Ashamed of what he has become, Shang-Chi goes into hiding in America and becomes Shaun (Simu Liu), but his past eventually catches up with him when his father sends his army, The Ten Rings, to steal the pendants given to him and his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) by their mother. Wenwu requires both pendants to reveal the way to Ta Lo, where he believes that his wife is being held captive by her people.This Marvel movie is at its most fun before the plot starts to get in the way and the CGI becomes too overbearing and intrusive: the early fight scenes - a battle on a runaway bus against a henchman known as Razor Fist, and a fight on some high-rise bamboo scaffolding - deliver lots of impressively choreographed action that will please both martial arts fans and superhero addicts. Awkwafina, as Shang-Chi's loyal friend Katy, provides some comic relief, but also gets stuck in with the action.Unfortunately, the film quickly goes downhill after the good guys make their way to Ta Lo, with a little help from Tony Slattery (see Iron Man 3) and a furry winged creature with no face. The inevitable battle between the villagers and Wenwu's army is typical overblown Marvel mayhem, but the massive CGI tsunami arrives when Wenwu opens the inter-dimensional gate that he thinks is holding Li prisoner: instead of releasing his wife, he frees a swarm of flying tentacled soul-suckers and their big bad boss The Dweller. Fortunately for the Ta Lo people, they have a massive magical dragon on their side, which wakes up and adds to the digital whizz-bangery.As technically impressive as the special effects are, I found the second half of the film visually overwhelming yet remarkably uninvolving - a whirlwind of pixels and noisy action without much substance.5/10.

4,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,This could've been great if it wasn't for the cheesy writing.,"The story was riddled with holes and plot issues. Since when does Awkwafina's pedestrian character all of a sudden get invited to become part of the MCU team? What's her super power... stupidity? Don't get me wrong, I love her, but her character was lazily written. Then there's the whole daddy issues dynamic - Shang is with him, then against, then with etc.. Then we have these ridiculous dragons fighting, where one scores some power crystals and becomes stronger! This is just infantile lazy writing. There was zero shock value or anything spectacular in the entire runtime, with tedious long middle acts and a bumbling third act. The jokes were cliched and not funny. The funniest parts were Ben Kingsley's character, (of whom was in this for what reasons??) and the ending to go Karaoke - which was the only time I actually cracked a chuckle. You'd think with three writers we'd have something cohesive and coherent. But instead of a Marvel superhero story, we got a Disney evil vs good with dragons thrown into the mix. It's as if they tried too hard to create the Asian version of Black Panther.It's a shame, because the directing and cinematography were spot on, and great S/VFX - although a little overboard with the CGI i.e. Dragons. The martial arts choreography was outstanding (although again, overboard after the awesome bus scene), and the casting and performances were excellent, especially Leung, who pretty much carried the film on his shoulders.

At it's best, the MCU can turn any obscure group or concept from the comics into gold, and Shang-Chi is no different.Shang-Chi might be one of the best examples of an idea that's actually better on film than the original source material, with the character's relationships, motivations, and place in the overall Marvel Universe all being improved upon in the film adaptation as opposed to the comics where he's mainly a hand-to-hand expert with no powers or special weapons, and isn't generally of much value to The Avengers.Simu Liu is charismatic and athletically gifted enough to do solid justice to the lead role. I hope the sequel gives him even more to do with his character and his legacy, but for an introduction, this was great. Awkwafina, Michelle Yeoh, and of course the legendary Tony Leung all lend their talents to a great cast of characters.Wen Wu is easily one of the top villain/antagonist characters in the MCU and probably all of comic book films. He's intimidating and masterful as a ruler, but heartfelt and believable as a family man. His presence elevates the entire production as he's a legend of cinema.There's moments reminiscent of Black Panther, and the third act gets heavy into Chinese mythological imagery, but understand that this is not only meant as a superhero movie, but also a love-letter to Chinese storytelling and culture.Shang-Chi features some of the best physical/non-super powered fight scenes in the MCU, with the choreography and the cinematography of said action taking a higher level. As soon as I saw the bus fight scene in the opening I had no worries about this part of the movie.The Ten Rings themselves are not a weapon used in the comics, and are a wonderfully creative, versatile, and visually stunning weapon unlike anything I've ever seen before, and that's not an easy thing to say having seen as much comic book and sci-fi material as me.Some of the pacing and character development could be a little better, but overall Shang-Chi is on the higher end of Marvel movies, and can also be solidly enjoyed by audiences totally unfamiliar with Marvel in general.","[['Shang-Chi', 'Marvel Comic', 'a decent amount', 'racist', 'imagery'], ['MCU', 'any obscure group', 'concept', 'gold', 'Shang-Chi', 'an idea', 'film', 'the original source', 'material', 'the character', 'place', 'Marvel Universe', 'the film', 'adaptation', 'a hand-to-hand', 'expert', 'much value', 'Avengers.Simu Liu', 'solid justice', 'the lead role'], ['the sequel', 'character', 'legacy', 'an introduction'], ['Awkwafina', 'Michelle Yeoh', 'course', 'Tony Leung', 'a great cast', 'characters.Wen', 'Wu', 'the top villain/antagonist', 'MCU', 'comic book'], ['a ruler', 'heartfelt', 'a family', 'man'], ['presence', 'the entire production', 'a legend', 'cinema.There', 'reminiscent', 'Black Panther', 'the third act', 'Chinese mythological imagery', 'a superhero', 'movie', 'a love-letter', 'Chinese storytelling', 'culture.Shang-Chi', 'physical/non-super powered fight', 'MCU', 'the choreography', 'the cinematography', 'action', 'level'], ['the bus', 'scene', 'the opening', 'this part', 'the movie.The', 'Ten Rings', 'a weapon', 'stunning weapon', 'anything', 'an easy thing', 'much comic book', 'sci-fi material', 'me.Some', 'the pacing', 'character', 'development', 'Shang-Chi', 'end', 'Marvel', 'Marvel']]","[['Shang-Chi', 'Marvel Comic', 'underutilized characters', 'comics', 'original comics', 'amount of racist imagery', 'embarrassing caricatures', 'various Asian stereotypes'], ['MCU', 'obscure group or concept', 'comics into gold', 'Shang-Chi', 'examples', 'idea', 'film', 'source material', 'character', 'relationships', 'motivations', 'place', 'Marvel Universe', 'film adaptation', 'comics', 'hand-to-hand expert', 'powers', 'special weapons', 'much value', 'Avengers.Simu Liu', 'solid justice', 'lead role'], ['sequel', 'character', 'legacy', 'introduction'], ['Awkwafina', 'Michelle Yeoh', 'course', 'Tony Leung', 'talents', 'cast of characters.Wen Wu', 'villain/antagonist characters', 'MCU', 'book films'], ['ruler', 'heartfelt', 'family man'], ['presence', 'entire production', 'legend of cinema.There', 'moments reminiscent', 'Black Panther', 'third act', 'Chinese mythological imagery', 'superhero movie', 'love-letter', 'Chinese storytelling', 'culture.Shang-Chi features', 'fight scenes', 'MCU', 'choreography', 'cinematography', 'action', 'level'], ['bus', 'scene', 'opening', 'worries', 'part', 'movie.The Ten Rings', 'weapon', 'comics', 'weapon unlike anything', 'easy thing', 'much comic book', 'material as me.Some', 'pacing', 'character development', 'overall Shang-Chi', 'end of Marvel movies', 'audiences', 'Marvel']]"
8,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,Surprisingly good,"I'll be honest - Marvel movies are not in my top 20 or even 50 but within the Marvel ""Universe"" I would say that Shang-Chi is in my top 5. I know, it's blasphemy and all that but think about it - is it better than Iron Man? I would admit yes - it's origin story is arguably better, and it's characters are a lot deeper. The Mandarin is a conflicted man, with evil but good as well, like real life. Is this movie better than The Avengers or Ragnarok or Infinity Wars? Hard to say, which means it's right up there with the best (of Marvel) in my opinion.Plus, I'm a sucker for Chinese movies with the Chinese language being spoken - 1 of my favourite of all times, if not my absolute favourite, is of course 'Hero.' The Chinese language and the artistry of it's culture are magnificent.All in all, well done Marvel, director Destin, and all those who worked to make this movie a reality.

Also, Awkwafina's acting style was already old by the 2nd movie she did... ALL of her characters in movies are the same person, and like I said, it got boring after the 2nd movie.

So, I'll just say that it looked great and would have been great to have seen it on the big screen.

18,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,More of the same from the hyperactive Marvell/Disney CGI-verse,"Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) discovers that his all-powerful and millennium-old father is about to launch an attack against the magical village where Shang-Chi's mother was born in the likely mistaken belief that his wife is not dead but is rather being held captive (there is more to the plot than one sentence can sum up but what does it matter... the story is just scaffolding for the special effects). Much fighting ensues but fortunately everyone eventually learns how to 'get along' when faced with a real threat. You have seen it all before: physics-defying martial arts, monsters who look like the recently swallowed strings of LED Christmas lights, conflicted heroes with wise-cracking 'comic relief' sidekicks (an awful Aquafina and an even more awful Ben Kingsley), giant melees featuring a variety of glowing weapons (but no blood), hyper-kinetic and hyper-implausible car/motorcycle chases, and a lot of clichéd wisecracks, tough-guy dialogue, poseur slo-mo, and heroic vogueing (we're treated to the venerable three-point power landing/slide a number of times). The only novel thing the film has to offer is the excellent rendering of mythological beasts from Chinese culture; otherwise, it's an overly-long (132 minutes, which is 120 minutes too much Aquafina), derivative, repetitive, and ultimately boring entry in the bloated, jejune Micky Mouse-Marvel superhero franchise.","[['Shang-Chi', 'Simu Liu', 'millennium-old father', 'an attack', 'the magical village', 'Shang-Chi', 'mother', 'the likely mistaken belief', 'wife', 'the plot', 'sentence', 'the story'], ['Much fighting', 'everyone', 'a real threat'], ['LED Christmas', ""wise-cracking 'comic relief"", 'Aquafina', 'Ben Kingsley', 'a variety', 'no blood', 'hyper-implausible car/motorcycle', 'a lot', 'clichéd', 'tough-guy dialogue', 'poseur slo-mo', 'heroic', 'vogueing', 'the venerable three-point power', 'a number'], ['The only novel thing', 'the film', 'the excellent rendering', 'Chinese culture', 'Aquafina', 'boring entry', 'Micky Mouse-Marvel', 'superhero', 'franchise']]","[['Shang-Chi', 'Simu Liu', 'millennium-old father', 'attack', 'magical village', 'Shang-Chi', 'mother', 'likely mistaken belief', 'wife', 'plot', 'sentence', 'story', 'special effects'], ['fighting ensues', 'everyone', 'real threat'], ['physics-defying martial arts', 'monsters', 'strings of LED Christmas lights', 'heroes', ""wise-cracking 'comic relief"", 'sidekicks', 'awful Aquafina', 'Ben Kingsley', 'giant melees', 'variety', 'weapons', 'blood', 'car/motorcycle chases', 'lot of clichéd wisecracks', 'tough-guy dialogue', 'poseur slo-mo', 'heroic vogueing', 'venerable three-point power', 'number of times'], ['only novel thing', 'film', 'excellent rendering', 'mythological beasts', 'Chinese culture', 'minutes', 'minutes', 'much Aquafina', 'boring entry', 'Micky Mouse-Marvel superhero franchise']]"

20,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,Ten Years too Late,"I've said this before about Marvel movies: they are a victim of their own success. ""Shang-Chi"" had to follow up a decade and a half of quality MCU movies, so the same movie that would've been a smash 10 years ago isn't viewed quite the same today. The movie was good, but it failed to really separate itself.""The Legend of Ten Rings"" as a title already sounds too much like LOTR. And in fact it was something like it in that he with the rings had the power. Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung) had the ten rings which gave him near omnipotence. With the ten rings he could defeat entire armies and live forever. He decided to use the rings to become a tyrant.He was willing to put his rings aside and grow old for the love of his life, a woman he found after living 1000 years. I thought it was a bit strange that it took the man 1000 years to find his true love, but I didn't dwell on it.Stranger than him taking a thousand years to find his true love was the woman who fell in love with him. She lived in a secret magical village in Macao that was totally isolated from the rest of the world. She was a gentle benign character who had powers herself and was able to defeat Wenwu when he came to essentially conquer her village. Somehow, through their Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon-esque battle they fell in love. Maybe that makes sense for him being that he finally found someone who could defeat him, but it didn't make sense for this nearly pure woman to fall for a man with a 1000 year history of tyranny.Still, they wed, forsook their powers and started a family.Their family would be unceremoniously destroyed when an old foe of Wenwu--a vicious gang--came by their house to get their pound of flesh and killed Wenwu's wife, Li (Fala Chen). Li could've attempted to barter with them for some sort of material exchange for their past losses, but instead she immediately decided she'd try to fight the entire gang and lost her life in the process. That would cause Wenwu to don the ten rings again and return to tyranny.So, if you're keeping score on Wenwu's wife, 1.) she was smitten with a man who came to destroy her village and 2.) she chose to fight an entire gang with no powers to speak of and with no attempts to negotiate.I recognize that it was a plot device to advance the plot, but it could've been done a lot better and with more tact. Her character never struck me as someone impulsive and/or not able to judge character yet she exhibited both flaws.Most of what I've covered was garnered throughout the movie via flashbacks. The real main character was Saun aka Shang-Chi (Simu Liu). He was the son of Wenwu and Li. Years later we see an adult Saun. He lives in SF and is a valet. He is violently thrust back into the life he ran away from when his father's goons came for the pendant around his neck given to him by his mother. It was at this point we learned his backstory, of which I've given some already. We find out he also has a sister, Xialing (Meng'er Zhang), who Disney not so subtly informed us she had to train herself to become a fierce warrior because of her gender. The two of them had been split up for close to twenty years when Saun ran away after being trained to be an assassin by his father. He was fourteen at the time and she was ten when he promised her he'd be back. He never came back and when they met again in Macao as adults she held the same ten-year-old bitterness against him for running away as though a fourteen-year-old should've been more reliable. She greeted him with a butt-kicking that was twenty years in the making. It's clear that it never crossed her mind that he may have been killed, or maybe she would've considered his death a betrayal as well. Either way it was a completely childish way to handle reuniting with your long lost brother.The two of them would join forces along with Saun's friend Katy (Awkwafina) and really quickly to stop their father. He was going to use the ten rings to breach a portal to another dimension which contained some soul-sucking demons.The introduction of demons to the movie did offer some excitement.

21,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,Next Phase,"It was an okay movie. Simu Liu is the son of the seemingly immortal master of the Ten Rings --always good to see Tony Leung, and I hope he soaked Disney --who winds up opposing his dad, and Awkwafina is his slacker sort-of girlfriend. They are fine in the leads, as is Meng'er Zhang as his sister, and Michelle Yeoh as their aunt -- always good to see her, and I hope she soaked Disney too.I have grown increasingly fond of martial arts films over the last couple of decades, and the decline of the movie musical is the reason why. They don't make movies like that any more, and when they try, they're often embarrassing. People don't like the unreality of people bursting out into song, or expressing their emotions through dance. No, they prefer the solid commonplace of people floating through space to kick each other in the head. To me, the fight choreography is its own dance, and the fight between Leung and Fala Chen when they meet and before they fall in love is a challenge dance as graceful as any between Astaire and Rogers.There are problems aplenty with this film. There's an immense amount of exposition, starting off with twenty minutes of it in Chinese.

24,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,It has a ring to it...,"Everybody around me raved about this movie, but I watched it very late and now I'm slightly disappointed. It didn't live up to all the hype and all the praise but seemed very much like any other Marvel movie. But what I am truly impressed with, was the blend of martial arts in the MCU, it fit so perfectly. This wasn't just another movie with a sprinkle of Asian characters for representation, no this actually tells their story, speaks their language, and depicts the details. The fight scenes are fun, there is some light comedy, no gore, and the CGI was gooooood. The backstory and narration made the fantasy seem real.It pulled at my heartstrings when it connected to Iron Man, I did not see that coming though it certainly made up for my disappointment with Awkwafina (Katy). The movie had a lot of slow parts and parts where I was losing interest and seemed somewhat like a good vs evil movie? Come to think of it, it felt like a Disney movie trying to teach me about Asian cultures and the inherent good in the universe.I'll agree it was dramatic and stays with you as 20 minutes post the movie, I was trying to channel the universe with open palms and gentle hand motions.

25,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,A weird mix of Marvel and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon,"As far as Marvel being a fantasy film they generally like to be grounded in reality of history of the world and the current setting... but this one is really really going into the fantasy setting of parallel universes of Chinese myth. So for me it kinda felt totally fantastical and not really connected to any of the other Marvel universe.The fight and chorography of the action scenes is impressive and entertaining and if a movie could be watched on that basis alone then this would do the job - unfortunately for Shang Chi you actually need a compelling story with interesting characters.... but what we got was the MASSIVELY overdone .. evil father and son who seeks redemption arc... other supporting characters were pretty much all one dimensional - either good or bad, black or white.I also felt that Samuel Liu was miscast in the main role... If Donnie Yen was younger he probably would have done a better job. Samuel just does not have the screen presence.Its entertaining for the kids but I think the adults will be bored.","[['Marvel', 'a fantasy', 'film', 'reality', 'history', 'the world', 'the current setting', 'the fantasy setting'], ['Marvel', 'universe.The fight', 'chorography', 'the action', 'a movie', 'that basis', 'the job', 'Shang Chi', 'a compelling story', 'MASSIVELY', 'overdone', '..', 'father', 'son', 'redemption', 'arc', 'white.I', 'Samuel Liu', 'the main role'], ['Donnie Yen', 'job'], ['Samuel', 'the screen', 'presence.Its']]","[['Marvel', 'fantasy film', 'reality of history', 'world', 'current setting', 'fantasy setting', 'parallel universes', 'Chinese myth'], ['other Marvel', 'universe.The fight and chorography', 'action scenes', 'movie', 'basis', 'job', 'Shang Chi', 'compelling story', 'interesting characters', 'MASSIVELY overdone ..', 'father and son', 'redemption arc', 'characters', 'white.I', 'Samuel Liu', 'main role'], ['Donnie Yen', 'job'], ['Samuel', 'screen presence.Its', 'kids', 'adults']]"
26,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,"Mediocre, shallow, flat - one of the worst MCU movies","I was excited for Shang-Chi. Infinity War and Endgame set the bar very high at the end of Phase 3. The MCU shows have been a mixed bag but Shang-Chi seemed exciting because the director has a decent track record and I hadn't heard of the character. I thought it would be a good way for the MCU to expand.But this is one of the most by-the-numbers superhero movies I've ever seen. Practically everything about it falls flat or feels superficial. The humour is obvious and lazy. The fighting is cool but the camera is too hyperactive to let me properly enjoy it. The CGI is over-used and seldom feels remotely convincing nor interesting.Although there's some backstory, it's boring and confusing. It's one thing to be told what happened in the past. It's much better if we understand why choices were made and feel the passage of time.As it is, I didn't relate to any of the characters much at all. Shaun and Katy are just annoying and frivolous. The villain is stubborn and not particularly intimidating. I probably liked Kingsley more than anyone else and his character could easily be removed without affecting the plot.The staging is incredibly artificial. So many shots contain characters simply standing in a line. Or walking in a line. It never feels natural. One part has the bad guys (Are they bad guys? Who cares?) park their jeeps in a row and then get out and stand in a row while the other army stand in, you guessed it, a row. This keeps happening.Some of the creature designs are kind of cool, like the dragons which look like stylised drawings rather than real creatures. But they lead nowhere. They aren't developed, nor hyped up before, just thrown in your face. Including the massive dragons at the end. To make a fight between giant, flying dragons boring is quite the achievement, but Shang-Chi pulls it off.Cliches abound in this bore-fest. The comedic relief sidekick learns archery in a day or two and saves the day with a ridiculous shot. Why didn't any of the archers who had years of training do the same thing? How can an arrow travel that far so easily? It cheapens everything. They didn't earn it, they just did it because that's what movies do, right?The physics are awful. Why do I care? Well, reality matters. I much prefer movies where things actually make sense than those where the pixels are having a seizure, characters say one-liners and there are no stakes or consistency at all. Ignoring physics means making up random events with no real danger, suspense or skill, on the part of the characters or the screenwriters.Shang-Chi is one of the most superficial movies I've seen for a while. Great entertainment for 10-year-olds, perhaps, but utterly dull to most true movie enthusiasts. The moments are forced and predictable. There's no magic, the music's forgettable, the acting and script tick boxes rather than engage you.At best, it has some colourful action and a few funny lines. It shows just how skillfully made good action movies are, including the Russo brothers MCU movies.","[['Shang-Chi'], ['Infinity War', 'Endgame', 'the bar', 'the end', 'Phase'], ['MCU', 'a mixed bag', 'Shang-Chi', 'the director', 'a decent track', 'record', 'the character'], ['a good way', 'MCU'], ['everything', 'feels superficial'], ['The humour'], ['The fighting', 'the camera'], ['CGI', 'some backstory'], ['thing', 'the past'], ['the passage', 'time.As'], ['Shaun', 'Katy'], ['The villain'], ['Kingsley', 'anyone', 'character', 'the plot.The', 'staging'], ['a line'], ['a line'], [], ['part', 'Are'], [], ['a row', 'a row', 'the other army', 'stand', 'a row'], ['happening.Some', 'the creature', 'kind', 'cool'], [], ['face'], ['the end'], ['a fight', 'the achievement', 'Shang-Chi', 'this bore-fest'], ['The comedic relief', 'sidekick', 'a day', 'the day', 'a ridiculous shot'], ['training', 'the same thing'], ['an arrow travel'], ['everything'], [], [], ['reality'], ['sense', 'a seizure', 'consistency'], ['no real danger', 'suspense', 'skill', 'the part', 'a while'], ['Great', 'entertainment', 'true movie'], [], ['no magic', 'the music', 'the acting', 'script', 'tick', 'some colourful action'], ['good action', 'Russo', 'MCU']]","[['Shang-Chi'], ['Infinity War', 'Endgame', 'bar', 'end of Phase'], ['MCU shows', 'mixed bag but Shang-Chi', 'director', 'track record', 'character'], ['good way', 'MCU', 'by-the-numbers', 'superhero movies'], ['everything', 'feels superficial'], ['humour'], ['fighting', 'camera'], ['CGI', 'seldom feels', 'backstory'], ['thing', 'past'], ['choices', 'passage of time.As', 'characters'], ['Shaun and Katy'], ['villain'], ['Kingsley', 'anyone', 'character', 'plot.The staging'], ['many shots', 'characters', 'line'], ['line'], [], ['part', 'bad guys', 'Are', 'bad guys'], [], ['jeeps', 'row', 'row', 'army stand', 'row'], ['happening.Some', 'creature designs', 'kind of cool', 'dragons', 'stylised drawings', 'real creatures'], [], ['face'], ['massive dragons', 'end'], ['fight', 'dragons', 'achievement', 'Shang-Chi', 'bore-fest'], ['relief sidekick', 'day', 'day', 'ridiculous shot'], ['archers', 'years of training', 'same thing'], ['arrow travel'], ['everything'], ['movies', 'physics'], [], ['reality matters'], ['movies', 'things', 'sense', 'pixels', 'seizure', 'characters', 'one-liners', 'stakes or consistency'], ['physics means', 'random events', 'real danger', 'suspense or skill', 'part', 'characters', 'superficial movies', 'while'], ['Great entertainment', '10-year-olds', 'movie enthusiasts'], ['moments'], ['magic', 'music', 'acting', 'script tick boxes', 'colourful action', 'few funny lines'], ['action movies', 'Russo brothers MCU movies']]"

This is just not a good movie. A lot of expensive visuals but that does not make a movie good.

It has some great fight scenes with some incredible fight choreography and epic large-scale battles. It is also has some good comedic scenes that made me laugh a couple of times. Where Shang-Chi suffers is when it comes to the plot. I didn't find the story very compelling and I didn't get that attached to the characters.

32,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,"Solid first half, messy second half","I liked the first half of this film and I thought it was a fine addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The backstory with the father and the mother was a nice wuxia inspiration and a cool way of introducing the Chinese theme to Marvel. The protagonist and Awkwafina had a believable friendship that struggled to balance enjoyment with living up to expectations. The tensed family relationship was a great focus as the father's gravity and charisma almost matched that of Thanos and feels like a truly deep human being. Throughout, the fight choreography was amazing, especially the bus scene.The second half was an obligatory CGI mess that takes the focus away from the family relationship. The epic legendary city of Ta Lo (Chinese version of Wakanda) is about thirty people living in a wooden village. That's all that stands between the world and a world-destroying demon, apparently. The hyped up final battle involves about ten soldiers with tasers. Wasn't the Ten Rings supposed to be a world-spanning empire? The fight between the dragons was so fast-paced that I couldn't tell what was going on.That said, there are flaws that occur in both of the halves. The Ten Rings (the organisation) is very vague in its nature and impact. Why are they so feared? How have they taken over the world? What are they capable of? Show, don't tell! The Ten Rings (the artifacts) don't seem to do much beyond flying around and projecting energy.

The story wasn't as tight as it could have been, but I found myself enjoying the whole movie regardless. The fight choreography was bangin', and all the action was just very well directed. Everything felt purposeful and exhilarating. The beginning of the movie feels like a straight-up martial arts movie and then as it progresses we get more and more fantasy elements working their way in which felt like a nice contrast. The music definitely felt like it added a lot here. I kept being reminded of how mixing different elements in with the more traditional orchestrated sounds really worked for Black Panther's soundtrack, and I honestly think this film did it even better.

46,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,This Movie was Amazing. Dont get why so much hate,"I thought this movie would suck honestly when i heard it was being made, i thought shang chi is a terrible character with no powers and then i always dread hollywood making asian movies lol.Im chinese by the way and when i finally watched it i was blown away!!! This was best movie of the year, maybe one of the best marvel movies that didnt involve a blockbuster teamup like avengers infinity wars and end game.So action packed, excellent script, insane graphic visuals, insane fighting choreography, alot of character depth and explorations. Well made indeed! This is the Black panther movie for all asians! I say all asians because chinese culture has affected all asian countries in the last 3000 years.Dont let the reviews bother you, alot of these people dont know what their talking about honestly. Seen 1 person mention theirs no villain But this movie takes villain into an indepth look. For every villain theirs a drive & purpose to why they do things and for this villain it involved love. Some may not be able to comprehend this as they view villains stone cold killers maybe or just destructive no emotion type of baddies.They wrote the script for this villain amazingly considering he was originally the Mandarin (a very stereotypical villain hated by asians). The clever way they were able to remove that racist heritage to this character was flawless, funny and amazing.I mean cmon it was hilarious the way the villain described how his name came.Some even complained they got lost during the whole movie which i found it hard to believe. I mean you must have Low IQ lmao go not understand n follow through the movie. From beginning to end it was a step through step process. Maybe they could have explored more about the magical lands but whois to say they wont in future movies?? All u needed to know was in the movie, and any other questions can be saved for the future just as most marvel movies always do.The fight scenes on the Bus were off the charts and so was the rest of it. I can see theirs many chinese people hating on this film cuz they feel the fighting style is too like Chinese movies fighting style But they dont get it. What made this movie very good was the amazing way they blended chinese and western movies together. The fight scenes was neither just chinese nor was it western, it was a perfect blend.This stories villajn was writting the way Thanos was but better. Thanos was not just crazy mad villain, he had purpose and feelings and goals that involved not just world domination or killing. Same with this villain, Tony Leung may have had not many lines in this movie but the way he carried his presence and the acting was outstanding.I have watched tony leung in hong kong movies for 30 years now and his acting is impeccable. He brought life to the Villain he played, and gave it a more down to earth and also relatable character portrayal. Anyone in his position in the movie would have had a chance to go his path, i know many might disagree but it was so easy to see how he deviated from the good path he took for some time back to evil. You just need to understand the character and his reasons and experiences.The main character Sima Liu i mean was pretty good choice, their were some scenes for fighting that looked to be him doing the stunts and it was amazing.I seen some complain that the movie should have been just mandarin but thats clearly a comment made by someone from China or mandarin speaking. To them they live in the old age where black is black, white is white, theirs no grey.Only way asians can move forward in hollywood is by a blend of both west n east.Maybe some people might hate it cause its so much asian characters n that its got mandarin language in it, then u got others who hate it cuz theirs english in it. Both groups need to grow up and live in the year 2021 cuz this movie was so successful because of the mixture of both cultures in 1.If this movie was just another straight chinese martial arts flick it would certainly not be successful in the west. This blend is what makes it open up to other races to watch and enjoy.The special effects of the movie was off the charts! Amazing!! The fighting too!This movie is the Black panther for asians. Its the opening door for asians to be introduced more commonly.If anyone in or from China reads this i think u should think hard to yourself, Do you want to see more chinese movies succeed in the future?? Cuz if so then u should ccheer this movie on cause its gonna open doors for chinese actors n actresses.China blocking this movie from playing makes no sense as the way for China to spread love is share their culture with all especially after the pandemic fiasco. This movie opens the doors of chinese culture up to westerners.So support this movie!

53,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,Actually Really Enjoyed It!,"Whoa! I watched Shang-Chi because I wanted to put something on in the background and I just ended up getting invested!I would go to say this is one of the best singular films in the MCU. I found films such as Thor and Black Panther slightly boring. They are full of information but I just couldn't get invested as much as I wanted too. I'd slightly fallen out of my obsession with the MCU over the past couple of years, but Shang-Chi could help bring my obsession back.It's about so many things at once, but the main plot is basically about Shang-Chi trying to find family with his friend Katie. That's the best way to describe it without minor spoilers. I believe this film really represented the culture well, and the scenery really helped to intrigue me to keep watching longer. The characters are all pretty likeable too and the fight scenes were amazing!A criticism I would have, which I have with many Marvel films, is that I feel like some scenes dragged on a little too long, but that's me really picking in details. I also found it hard to follow the plot at one point, but I soon picked back up what was happening.I really recommend this, even if you're not a fan of the MCU. I'd say it's one of Marvels strongest movies that has released recently! Really looking forward to where Marvel takes this series next.","[['Whoa'], ['Shang-Chi', 'something', 'the background', 'MCU'], ['Thor', 'Black Panther'], ['information'], ['obsession', 'MCU', 'the past couple', 'Shang-Chi', 'obsession', 'back.It', 'the main plot', 'Shang-Chi', 'family', 'friend', 'Katie'], ['way'], ['this film', 'the culture', 'the scenery', 'watching'], ['the fight', 'A criticism', 'Marvel'], ['the plot', 'point', 'a fan', 'MCU'], ['Marvels'], ['Marvel', 'this series']]","[['Whoa'], ['Shang-Chi', 'something', 'background', 'singular films', 'MCU'], ['films', 'Thor', 'Black Panther'], ['information'], ['obsession', 'MCU', 'couple of years', 'Shang-Chi', 'obsession back.It', 'many things', 'main plot', 'Shang-Chi', 'family', 'friend Katie'], ['way', 'minor spoilers'], ['film', 'culture', 'scenery', 'watching'], ['characters', 'fight scenes', 'criticism', 'Marvel films', 'scenes', 'details'], ['plot', 'point', 'fan', 'MCU'], ['Marvels', 'movies'], ['Marvel', 'series']]"
54,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,Shang Cheese,"Totally unpopular opinion here and I might be the only one, but I really didn't like it; even going into it with no expectations. I wasn't too keen on the movie in the first place, but I was swayed by everybody who watched it and said it was brilliant. What a mistake. I felt the movie was incredibly dull, generic, utterly cliched and stereotyped. Crap characters, formulaic plot, and not even all that funny. As soon as the movie opened with a Chinese battle banner and the twang of guzheng notes, I knew it would be bad. The action and fight scenes aren't even all that great: they relied way too much on CG. I feel like the action was nothing special: Jackie Chan (and Yuen Wah whom you'll see in Shang Chi) in his hey-day produced way better action and fights without CG. Back when The Matrix first came out, that was mind-blowing action that Western audiences haven't seen before. If you've seen any number of Hong Kong martial arts movies you'll know what I mean. The third act of the movie was a total rip-off of the last battle in How to Train Your Dragon. Also an absolute waste of great actors like Michelle Yeoh who was given nothing to do, she practically dialled in her part. Positives though: Tony Leung. He's the one redeeming grace of this terrible and lazy movie.","[['unpopular opinion'], ['the movie', 'the first place', 'everybody'], ['a mistake'], ['the movie'], ['Crap', 'formulaic', 'plot', 'that funny'], ['the movie', 'a Chinese battle', 'banner', 'the twang', 'guzheng'], ['The action', 'fight', 'way', 'CG'], ['the action', 'nothing', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Yuen Wah', 'Shang Chi', 'hey-day', 'way', 'action', 'CG'], ['Matrix', 'mind-blowing action'], ['any number', 'Hong Kong'], ['The third act', 'the movie', 'a total rip-off', 'the last battle', 'How', 'Dragon'], ['an absolute waste', 'Michelle Yeoh', 'nothing', 'part'], ['Tony Leung'], ['grace', 'lazy movie']]","[['unpopular opinion', 'expectations'], ['movie', 'first place', 'everybody'], ['mistake'], ['movie'], ['Crap characters', 'formulaic plot', 'funny'], ['movie', 'battle banner', 'twang of guzheng notes'], ['action', 'fight scenes', 'way', 'CG'], ['action', 'nothing', 'Jackie Chan', 'Yuen Wah', 'Shang Chi', 'hey-day', 'way', 'action', 'fights without CG'], ['Matrix', 'mind-blowing action', 'Western audiences'], ['number of Hong Kong', 'arts movies'], ['third act', 'movie', 'total rip-off', 'battle in How', 'Dragon'], ['absolute waste', 'actors like Michelle Yeoh', 'nothing', 'part'], ['Positives', 'Tony Leung'], ['grace', 'lazy movie']]"
55,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,Works as an introductory movie but has a boring story,"This film manages to introduce the character in this universe, but the story that unfolds is boring.The conflict changes several times, it even takes the main character to a lake to concentrate on something else, it becomes cyclical, it is incongruous, it has many script holes, you do not feel much emotion when the fights appear.

Awkwafina does her comedic thing. Simu Liu does a good every-man performance but he's also a good straight man to Awkwafina. I like the pairing although they may be better as friends. Then the movie surprises with a comedic turn from Ben Kingsley. I love that part which gave the movie a comedic jolt. I wouldn't mind him popping up in other MCU stuff.

In the movie there are a lot of fantastic beings which I really liked. The more I liked that it was a kind of karate movie. When I think about it, that was something new when it comes to Marvel. The main character seems personable and it's fun to watch his story unfold. What I can tell you is that this tells the story of how Shang-Chi got the ten rings.

71,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,Shang is lamest superhero of the decade,"The movie was entertaining to some degree and followed the standard Marvel Universe formula. Trite, current day pop cultural references and jokes during the first half of the movie were cheap and certainly will be lost on audiences of the future. A few idiots in the theatre guffawed loudly at most of them. As usual, though, the women were strong, kind and intelligent and the men were dumb and evil. Are we to believe that the most evil man in the Universe, Xi, is going to change his evil ways and that his wife would have even married a mass murderer on the scale of Genghis Kahn or Vlad the Impaler? Of course she's killed by his enemies and he returns to a life of evil and sends his henchmen to kill his own children to retrieve some necklaces so he can read a map. I will say Xi was a badass, as were Shang's sister, Aunt, and pretty much every other character compared to Shang, who was soft and definitely not superhero material. Awkwafina was funny and entertaining as usual, overshadowing Shang in most scenes as his character was so forgettably boring. Even his Aunt could kick his butt. Loved Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin, extremely funny and his performance was genius. The outcome was the usual for Marvel Universe and even the pre-view for the next movie during the credits was lame; I guess they could only get Mark Ruffalo and Brie Larson, perhaps the only two Marvel Universe characters lamer than Shang, to set up the next movie.","[['The movie', 'some degree', 'Marvel Universe', 'formula'], ['Trite', 'current day', 'the first half', 'the movie', 'the future'], ['the theatre'], ['kind', 'intelligent'], ['evil man', 'Universe', 'Xi', 'wife', 'a mass', 'murderer', 'the scale', 'Genghis Kahn', 'Vlad', 'Impaler'], ['course', 'a life', 'a map'], ['Xi', 'a badass', 'Shang', 'sister', 'Aunt', 'every other character', 'Shang', 'superhero material'], ['Awkwafina', 'Shang', 'character'], ['Aunt', 'butt'], ['Ben Kingsley', 'Mandarin', 'performance', 'genius'], ['The outcome', 'Marvel Universe', 'the pre-view', 'the next movie', 'Mark Ruffalo', 'Brie Larson', 'Marvel Universe', 'Shang', 'the next movie']]","[['movie', 'degree', 'Marvel Universe formula'], ['Trite', 'current day', 'cultural references and jokes', 'first half', 'movie', 'audiences', 'future'], ['few idiots', 'theatre'], ['women', 'kind and intelligent', 'men'], ['evil man', 'Universe', 'Xi', 'evil ways', 'wife', 'mass murderer', 'scale of Genghis Kahn', 'Vlad', 'Impaler'], ['course', 'enemies', 'life', 'henchmen', 'own children', 'necklaces', 'map'], ['Xi', 'badass', 'Shang', 'sister', 'Aunt', 'other character', 'Shang', 'superhero material'], ['Awkwafina', 'Shang', 'scenes', 'character'], ['Aunt', 'butt'], ['Ben Kingsley', 'Mandarin', 'performance', 'genius'], ['outcome', 'Marvel Universe', 'pre-view', 'next movie', 'credits', 'Mark Ruffalo', 'Brie Larson', 'Marvel Universe characters', 'Shang', 'next movie']]"
72,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,Awesome.,"Best fight scenes since the civil war airport scene. They mess up simply by trying to make the character 10 years younger then the actor is.

It was a magnificent freaking story. The legend, the fighting, the story, and the tremendous acting were all there. This is as good an MCU movie as there ever was. I was totally blown away by it. It was a great idea to have top actors in the movie and let them do their thing.

75,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,A very well-made Marvel movie that deserves a lot of praise!,"""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is one of the best productions of Marvel Studios. I had very big expectations for this movie and it didn't disappoint, mostly because it's based on asian people and martial arts and I am a very big fan of this genre. Only the idea to make a Marvel's movie which is based on martial arts is very interesting, even If there are already some comics on which this movie is based on.The movie has all you could expect from a movie made of Marvel, but the special effects and the CGI are the strongest points of this one. I even regret it that I didn't watch it in a cinema, because it's clear that the movie has been made to put into the light the enormous ammount of special effects, on a big screen. I've also been impressed by the acting and even the storyline it's not bad. It's clear enough that is has been put a lot of effort in the well-making of this movie and it seems to me that they really achieved what they've wanted to.""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" it's a movie that shines through it's CGI, acting and storytelling.","[['Legend', 'Ten Rings', 'Marvel Studios'], ['this movie', 'big fan', 'this genre'], ['the idea', 'Marvel', 'movie', 'this movie', 'on.The movie', 'a movie', 'Marvel', 'CGI', 'this one'], ['a cinema', 'the movie', 'the enormous ammount', 'a big screen'], ['the acting', 'the storyline'], ['a lot', 'effort', 'the well-making', 'this movie'], ['Legend', 'Ten', 'a movie', 'CGI']]","[['Legend', 'Ten Rings', 'productions of Marvel Studios'], ['big expectations', 'movie', 'asian people', 'martial arts', 'big fan', 'genre'], ['idea', 'Marvel', 'movie', 'martial arts', 'comics', 'movie', 'on.The movie', 'movie', 'Marvel', 'special effects', 'CGI', 'points', 'one'], ['cinema', 'movie', 'enormous ammount', 'special effects', 'big screen'], ['acting', 'storyline'], ['lot of effort', 'well-making', 'movie'], ['Legend', 'Ten Rings', 'movie', 'CGI']]"

Because where the story falls, everything else excels.Shang-Chi is visually spectacular and a real treat for the eyes with some visuals that are incredibly distinct for the MCU. In regards to aesthetics, Black Panther walked so Shang-Chi could run a marathon.The fight scenes are all amazing. There's one weak fight, but it's meant to be weak, and they're all very long, which is great to see. One of the early ones went on for a solid 5 - 10 minutes, which was unexpected but far from disappointing.The first actual fight scene is my favourite in the MCU, and I was worried none of the others would top it, but they were all delightful to watch, and I was so glad they did a parallel of it later on. Either way, the writers went hard on the fight scenes and that paid off.In summary, the story is lacking, but I'm glad in a way because that allowed everything else to shine. And shine, it did.

84,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,Reposting this review again.,"I had low expectations for this movie. First off, the soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal. It's so god damn beautifully well-done. The storyline is extremely brilliant where it explores how this man found the Ten Rings that gifted him with unlimited power and immortality that kept him alive for thousands of years, would create an organization known as the Ten Rings who would later be responsible for the Kidnapping of Tony Stark in Afghanistan, Aldrich Killian's madness.After their job, the two ride on a bus, but only to encounter the Ten Rings and a guy with a ""freakin' machete"". I have to say, though. This scene's choreography was god damn great, and the music made it even better. After the attack, Katy begins to question Shang's motives. Shang explains the backstory of how he came to be, and that he needed to go visit his long-lost sister. They take the airplane to China. The two arrive in this underground fighting club that was broadcasted to the Dark Web only to encounter a guy who told him to sign to fight, even though Shang didn't know what he was signing up for. We get to see a cameo of the Abomination fighting Wong. I have to say that the CGI was better on him in every level. I am quite glad that the writers are starting to acknowledge The Incredible Hulk. Shang is up to fight an unknown opponent, and it is revealed that it is his sister. Shang tries to talk to her that he doesn't want to fight which basically led to him getting his *** kicked. (( Have to put asterisks so that IMDb won't delete this review, so don't be surprised. ))After the fight, Shang tells his sister, Xialing about the Ten Rings situation. They soon realize that the Ten Rings attack the club which leads us to another action scene. Unrelated, but I have noticed that people have been complaining that MCU Heroes don't kill. I'm pretty sure that they did kill since the beginning where Iron Man used his Mark I to light his victims on fire, blowing up multiple people, fatal blasts, etc. The Death Dealer steals Xialing's pendant, capturing the three of them to the Ten Rings Headquarters to reunite with their father waiting for them. Back at the Headquarters, Wenwu explains how there is still hope to save their mother by finding Ta Lo to save Ying. Wenwu uses the two pendants to place them on the dragon's eyes generating a map made of water showing them the secret passage through the bamboo maze, and the perfect time where it can be granted. Wenwu tells them that if the people of Ta Lo won't comply, he will burn down the village with no mercy. Shang is against this. Wenwu throws them in the catacombs. The three hear some weird noises only to encounter Trevor who was the Fake Mandarin in Iron Man 3! If you didn't know, there was a short that explains Slattery's experience in jail. In the end, he is captured by the Ten Rings. Morris comes out of the corner, telling Trevor the true path.Xialing discovers that there are escape routes, the team hijacks Razor's car which leads us to another fight sequence. They soon approach the bamboo forest maze. Katy is assisted where to turn by Morris and Slattery. Finally, they enter a waterfall, arriving at the Ta Lo village. Guang Bo tells the group to turn back. Ying Nan delays that order, meeting her niece and nephew. Although, I did realize this was Michelle Yeoh who portrayed Philippa Georgiou in Star Trek: Discovery. I do need to catch up as I lost interest. Ying tells them a story where in ancient times, their village was attacked by this extra-dimensional draconic entity who can suck the ever-living souls out of people and its minions can, too. But, the Great Protector, and sealed away behind the Dark Gate, trapping it for many centuries. Here, we have a training montage where we see Shang-Chi being trained in the same arts that were used to defeat Wenwu, Xialing practices with this what seems to be a rope dart, and Chen learning archery. The next day, Wenwu and the Ten Rings, also Razor Fist, and the Death Dealer arrive. Nan tells Wenwu that his wife isn't behind the Dark Gate, but the Soul Eaters were luring him to a trap.We begin the climactic third act. Nan fights with the Death Sealer, Xialing fights Razor Fist. Meanwhile, Shang notices his father walking away to his wife's memorial, but is distracted by several warriors for a brief moment. As he approaches his father, he told him that he isn't afraid. Episode V vibes here when Luke tells Yoda where he promises that he won't fail him and not be afraid. ""Oh, you will be. You will be."" They begin to fight until Wenwu uses the same movement that he killed the gang who killed his wife on Shang into the depths of water, believing that his son is dead. He does a Jedi Jump moment to the Dark Gates using the rings to break it down and free his wife. This makes the situation worse by releasing an army of Soul Eaters. In the village, Xialing tries to ally with Razor Fist to help to take down the Soul Eaters. His mind is changed when the Death Dealer's soul was sucked out, he tells the Ten Rings to stop and help the villagers. I have to say, this part was terrifying and how he falls dead, no movement. It is crazy how death does that. Back to Shang-Chi, he regains consciousness with the help of the Great Protector rising out of the water. The Great Protector begins to eat the Soul Eaters. Shang-Chi makes his way to his father to furthermore convince him that his wife isn't behind the Dark Gates. Wenwu ignores this, continuing the fight. Wenwu uses half of his rings at his son, but Shang catches them and gaining control of 'em. The fight gets more intense to the point where the Dweller is unleashed and slowly absorbs Wenwu's soul. During his final moments, he gives his son the rings. The battle suffered many losses including Master Guang Bo. Chen launches an arrow at the Dweller's weak port, causing it to be weakened. The Great Protector starts to kick the ever-living crap outta it, making it explode. In the Aftermath, the villagers attend a ceremony as the lanterns of those who died slowly ""swam"" across the ocean. Finally, it was all about a true story where Shang was explaining his recent adventure to a couple. Obviously, they don't believe him just until Wong uses his yellow sparkly thing bringing Shang and Katy to discuss the rings. We get a cameo of Captain Marvel and Bruce Banner. This time, Captain Marvel didn't get another haircut, lol. Interesting how Professor Hulk somehow returned to his human form. I strongly assume that his right arm is more painful since he returned as a human. In the end credits, we see Xialing becoming the new leader of the Ten Rings.There are A LOT of fantastic characters here. Starting off with Shang-Chi, I have to say that he had an excellent performance where he seems to be brave, showing no cowardice to his father, has lovely chemistry with his best friend he had known for 10 years, Katy, wants nothing to do with his family, often feels guilty for leaving Xialing. I have to say, though. Speaking of Katy, I liked how she wasn't full-on comedic throughout the film and became a badass. I do find it interesting that we have two archers now. Hawkeye and Katy. I quite like how we didn't have any romance (( besides Wenwu's romantic relationship with Ying Li. ))Wenwu. What to say on this. He is one of the best Marvel villains ever. Although, he wasn't one, and he had actual motives rather than being the usual MCU villain, but the storytelling is wonderful. He was a ruthless leader killing multiple people. Then one day, he stumbled upon a woman, ditches away his organization, became a better caring & loving man to raise two children until his wife was killed, seeking revenge on her murder, became a flawed father having no time toward his children like ditching Xialing. What. A. Tragic. Story. I am starting to notice that Phase 4 is exploring the effects of grief like Wanda's love for Vision, Sylvie's hatred for the TVA, and Corrupted Doctor Strange trying to bring back his love. Tony Leung's performance killed it. I loved how they were ditching away with the Mandarin stuff.I have to say that the Ten Rings (( no, not the organization. )) is completely badass, more interesting than the repulsors, the Mjolnir, Stormbreaker, a million-pound sharp-edged metal frisbee, the iconic Scepter, a cross-bow that can do many things, a prosthetic titanium/vibranium arm that can overpower almost anything, Quad Blasters that go pew pew, the Godslayer that can cut through anything, basic daggers, a laser cannon, yaka arrow that can travel by whistling, electroshock batons, carbon-fibered specialized winged jetpack, and vibranium claws. Wanda's psionic energy manipulation, size/insect manipulation, web-shooters, eldritch magic, and the Infinity Gaunlet are the only cool things along with the Ten Rings. You can make an energy blast, put 10 rings on one arm to do a super-punch, extend into a energy whip, shields, big jumps, etc. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention. The fight between Wenwu & Ying was god damn jaw-dropping. Wenwu is a 10/10 character.For Xu Xialing, she became likable in the later halfs of the movie. Her backstory is heartbreaking, because of her gender, she couldn't train with her brother Shang. Although, she learned to train on her own. Rather than her unpleasant behavior, she has great bonds with women, emotional, a really interesting relationship with her brother. For Ying Nan, she is marvellous. She dealt with the loss of her sister, and wise. I enjoyed Guang Bo so much, he's wise, has a deep heart for his village. I was devastated of his death. Trevor. I enjoyed so much for him and his deep relationship for Morris, he is so fun! ""Calm down, mate. I'm not actually dead, it's just a performance, play along."" I do wish that the Death Dealer was done better rather than being treated dirty. He was badass, completely threatening, and the same potential of Taskmaster. The movie has excellent pacing, that's all I have to say.","[['this movie'], ['First', 'the soundtrack'], ['god damn'], ['The storyline', 'this man', 'Ten Rings', 'unlimited power', 'immortality', 'an

The magical elements in the movie were a refreshing change from all the aliens we've been seeing in Marvel movies lately. However, you can watch this movie without having seen any other Marvel movies before.The fight scenes were well choreographed, maybe almost too slick looking? They reminded me of Jackie Chan fights with how precise they were. Despite beating each other severely, no one seems to bleed in any of these fights, so it might have been better if it took the leap into R rating territory like Deadpool.Although some scenes had slightly janky looking CGI - it was only a little sub-par in places. The final action set-piece is epic though, proving Shiang Chi is a force to be reckoned with in the MCU.As with all the MCU movies, it doesn't take itself too seriously, with moments of humour. Although sometimes you'd wish they would be a bit more serious, I guess it's the MCU formula to add humour. It's reasonably well paced, although these movies are always longer than they need to be. Then you have to sit through end-credit scenes that hint at the mysterious origins of the 10 rings, and a potential sequel or tie in with another MCU movie.Overall, it's not bad, a good adventure, some good fights, and a BIG finish.","[['This story', 'Marvel', 'hero', 'Doctor Strange', 'Iron Man'], ['the movie', 'a refreshing change', 'Marvel'], ['this movie', 'Marvel'], ['Jackie Chan'], ['no one', 'the leap', 'R', 'rating', 'territory', 'Deadpool.Although', 'CGI'], ['The final action', 'set-piece', 'Shiang Chi', 'a force', 'MCU.As', 'MCU', 'humour'], ['a bit', 'MCU', 'formula', 'humour'], [], ['end-credit', 'a potential sequel', 'tie', 'MCU', 'movie.Overall', 'a good adventure', 'BIG', 'finish']]","[['story', 'Marvel hero adventures', 'Doctor Strange', 'Iron Man'], ['magical elements', 'movie', 'refreshing change', 'aliens', 'Marvel movies'], ['movie', 'Marvel movies', 'fight scenes'], ['Jackie Chan fights'], ['one', 'fights', 'leap into R rating territory', 'Deadpool.Although', 'scenes', 'CGI', 'places'], ['action set-piece', 'Shiang Chi', 'force', 'MCU.As', 'MCU movies', 'moments of humour'], ['bit', 'MCU formula', 'humour'], ['movies'], ['end-credit scenes', 'mysterious origins', 'rings', 'potential sequel or tie', 'MCU movie.Overall', 'good adventure', 'good fights', 'BIG finish']]"

At least actors like John Cho plays roles that puts an even footing with their other counter parts. This movie is more of a marvel's attempt to please the Chinese market for profit.

Shang and his sister Xialing played by Meng'er Zhang had witnessed their mother's death and work together to avenge her legacy and to protect the lands that her people came from. The plot was fun to watch with great visual effects and great supporting cast that also included Awkwafina as the hero sidekick along with Michelle Yeoh who helps train Shang the ways of his mother's unique way to defend.

It would have been better if It took place in the 70's and had more of an Enter The Dragon vibe. What we get is anything but.

But then it has Ben Kingsley who was out of place in it and a furry creature called Morris that was stupid and unnecessary and should have been ommitted from the movie. It's like a furry pig with wings with no head or face that makes sounds like an Ewok or Gizmo from Gremlins. So dumb. There are some amusing moments but then I find it irritating that something funny has to be thrown in at odd moments. Like most Marvel films. Give it a break. Please. The ending is something out of a Rodan, Godzilla movie. When watching this I thought is this really a Marvel movie or a B movie from made in Japan. I did like the first half of Shang Chi. The second half was just ok. I saw it free because I had a free ticket from my club card. I'm glad I did. Even when I saw the trailer I wasn't expecting anything. I can see why.

143,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,Worst story and plot ever.,This is by far the most nonsensical plot in a Marvel film and one of the worst stories I've ever witnessed. It's so hard to make sense of anything at all in this film. The only good thing is some of the action sequences. Bus fight is spectacular but after that it goes completely downhill cause only after that does the plot actually unfold. And it is so ridiculous and so full of nonsense that I was thoroughly bored whenever anything other than the fight scenes were on.I think Marvel is done. This phase seems completely relying on the success of the previous one. The only good thing is Spider-Man and I'm eagerly looking forward to No Way Home. After this I don't have any expectations from Marvel films other than Spider-Man.The humour in this movie is pure cringe. It feels too forced and Awkwafina is completely out of place. The last scene where they sing Hotel California is so damn cringy. It's a tragedy that they thought people would enjoy it. This is a really bad film minus the action sequences.

144,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,Bad acting in a nauseating CGI crapfest,"The first thing that jumps out at you here is how uneven the acting is compared to the usual Marvel movies. Actors alternate between overacting, pathos and subdued attempts at coolness. Add the usual Marvel style self-referential wink wink humor, and the obligatory 30 minute CGI showdown with purple light themed villains and monster (for the... 15th time now?), and you end up with a jarring, nauseating tonal mess of a movie.It's the same movie over and over again, same exact story beats, same pacing, same style soundtrack, same jokes, same trashy special effects laden battle at the end.They tried to gimmick things up with Kung Fu here (because that's apparently what Disney think people want to see in movies with an Asian cast), but you've seen it all before dozens of times, and better at that. The martial arts fight in public transport has been done to death (recently quite well in ""Nobody"", but also in Marvel films like Captain Marvel), and in general the fights pale against movies like Matrix, John Wick or any Jackie Chan classic.The reality is that Marvel movies feel dated and played out, with nowhere to go except from one CGI battle to the next.

148,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,Highly Overrated and Forgettable MCU Film,"Shang-Chi is another bad and boring addition to Marvel's weakest Phase in the MCU (Phase 4). It made less money at the worldwide box office than Godzilla versus Kong in the same ""pandemic era."" The lead actor is boring in the film and pretentious outside the film...mocking fans, berating any constructive or genuine criticism, and spouting a bunch of foolishness on his social media that may get him canceled in the near future by one of the many angry Twittermobs. He basically is the male Brie Larson of the MCU. What could have been an action-packed, fun, exciting Kung Fu film in the MCU collapsed into a lame CGI-fest in the third act--think of the Dragon Ball Z or Avatar films that bombed at the box office. Once again, we had an overpaced origin story...watching Shang-Chi go from being an insecure valet, to getting kicked in the balls by his sister while shirtless in a cage fight with her...despite him being the ""Master of Kung Fu,"" only then to ""saving the universe"" in the third act...all in his first film...while also confronting his feelings and emotional issues with his father. He learns how to use the Ten Rings in a matter of minutes without any learning curve, which is ridiculous, and duels an evil dragon with his own good dragon. The rings aren't even the Mandarin's rings from the comics, but rather ten mystical bracelets. The supporting cast is forgettable, and the jokes are dryer than cracker-juice. Even Michelle Yeoh's star power is wasted and forgotten--most people don't even know she's in this film, which is a shame as she has helped pave the way for these lead and supporting actors and actresses in the film. The supporting actress Awkwafina feels outdated already, even though she just seems to be breaking onto the film scene as ""Marvel's Katy."" There is very bad chemistry between Shang-Chi and Marvel's Katy...what could've been a romance with a different, more competent actor/actress pairing and writer was more of the ""friend-zone"" at best. You definitely don't root for these two to fall in love and wonder if they even would. No chemistry, no tension...fully neutered...or possibly closeted (for now) to pander to a Chinese audience whose government wouldn't show the film in spite of pandering to them. Finally, Shang-Chi's sister is the real master of Kung Fu because she managed to become a better fighter than him, start an entire fight club in another country, all by watching him train and fight with Kung Fu masters while the patriarchy in her culture prevented her from studying martial arts with her brother.

149,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,Precious ... ten times,"Of course I am just riffing off, teasing and making fun of certain things with my summary line. Though there is some truth in there too - especially if you consider the last third of the movie - quite fantastical, pun intended.But there is so much more here. And while you may have seen the bus scene already (I imagine many times), it still is quite the highlight and works wonders! Because there is even more to it than the trailer/teaser revealed! As is with the plot and the characters of the movie.I was able to watch it on an Imax screen and let me tell you ... wow! But also wow and much respect to Marvel and Feige and anyone involved that they dared to make the first ten minutes or so in chinese! And throwing a lot of chinese terms (slang?) in there as well - throughout! That gives it a touch of authenticity. How immigrants in America or anywhere else in the world grew up. I do the same with my Greek and German/English.It is also nice and while I am prone to be sarcastic, I really think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation - especially nowadays with Anti-Asian hate/crime rising. All because of people blaming China and people of China for a virus ... the movie does not have that as a topic, it is entertainment after all, but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned. Good for them and good for us, that this was made.I am a bit biased when it comes to the MCU and this did get a pure theatrical release, instead of the Black Widow treatment (which also was available on Disney plus and the cinemas at the same time). So there is not issue when it comes to that. And if you can watch it on the big screen - you will not be dissapointed! Now waiting for the other stuff to drop ... especially after the mid credit scene, that is such a tease ... the after the credits scene might also hint at something, but the bigger tease was midway through the credits (actually almost at the beginning of them to be honest).Sit back and enhoy the movie and the really funny characters ... and quite a few familiar faces.

Tony Leung is a legend and gives a wonderful performance as a complicated and tortured antagonist. There is great humor (not to everyone's liking it seems) and heart. My only critique is really the usual devolvement into the CGI battlefest that MCU movies always wind up becoming, but that's a minor quibble in a solid movie.","[['Shang Chi', 'Disney+', 'the first time', 'the theater'], ['This movie', 'action', 'MCU', 'forward.The'], ['exposition', 'the movie', 'the plot', 'character'], [], ['storytelling'], ['Get'], ['cultural identity', 'family', 'love.Awkwafina', 'Simu', 'great chemistry'], ['Menger', 'badass'], ['Tony Leung', 'a legend', 'a wonderful performance', 'tortured antagonist'], ['great humor', 'everyone', 'heart'], ['only critique', 'the usual devolvement', 'CGI', 'MCU', 'a minor quibble', 'a solid movie']]","[['Shang Chi', 'Disney+', 'first time', 'theater'], ['movie', 'action', 'MCU', 'new films', 'forward.The', 'ten minutes', 'subtitles'], ['exposition and flashbacks', 'movie', 'nuances', 'plot', 'character motivations'], [], ['storytelling'], ['Get'], ['references', 'cultural identity', 'immigrants', 'family', 'love.Awkwafina and Simu', 'great chemistry'], ['Menger', 'badass'], ['Tony Leung', 'legend', 'wonderful performance', 'tortured antagonist'], ['great humor', 'everyone', 'heart'], ['only critique', 'usual devolvement', 'CGI', 'MCU movies', 'minor quibble', 'solid movie']]"
155,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,Out of the Marvel patterns,"I had very few expectations from this one, given the fact that it was an origin story with a character I know zero facts about.

There are a lot of new elements that Marvel seemed to experience with and it worked out perfectly.

164,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe made a big impact with an almost all-black cast in Black Panther, then this film came along and gave the world its first high-profile Asian superhero, and from the trailer I saw, it looked very exciting. Basically, thousands of years ago, Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung) discovered ten mystical iron rings, granting its user immortality and other great powers. He establishes the Ten Rings organisation and throughout history conquers kingdoms and topples governments. In 1996, wanting to expand his power, Wenwu goes in search for Ta Lo, a mystical heavenly realm inhabited by Chinese mythological creatures. He travels through a magical forest to the Ta Lo village entrance but is stopped by guardian Ying Li (Fala Chen). The two fall in love, but Li leaves with Wenwu when he is rejected by the villagers. Wenwu abandons the Ten Rings, and they have two children, Shang-Chi and Xialing. When Shang-Chi is seven years old (Jayden Zhang), Li is murdered by Wenwu's enemies, the Iron Gang. Wenwu once again wields the rings to massacre the Iron Gang, resumes leadership of his organisation, and has Shang-Chi go through brutal training in martial arts. Xialing from childhood (Elodie Fong) secretly copies this training. When Shang-Chi is fourteen (Arnold Sun), Wenwu sends him to assassinate the leader of the Iron Gang. But Shang-Chi is demoralised after fulfilling his mission and decides to run away to America, settling in San Francisco and changing his name to ""Shaun"". In the present day, Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) works as a valet with his best friend Katy (Awkwafina), who knows nothing about his past. They are attacked on a bus by the Ten Rings, led by high-ranking agent Razor Fist (Florian ""Big Nasty"" Munteanu) who steal a pendant that Shang-Chi was given by his mother. Wenwu anonymously provides Shang-Chi with the location of his sister and, fearing that the Ten Rings will go after Xialing's matching pendant from their mother, Shang-Chi decides to meet her. He reveals his past to Katy, who insists on helping him. They find Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) at an underground fight club in Macau, which she founded after escaping from Wenwu. The Ten Rings attack the fight club and Wenwu arrives to capture Shang-Chi, Katy, Xialing, and her pendant. They are taken to the Ten Rings' compound, where Wenwu uses the pendants to reveal a magical map leading to Ta Lo. Wenwu explains that he has heard Li calling to him and believes she is alive and being held captive in Ta Lo behind a sealed gate. He plans to destroy the village unless they release her. When Shang-Chi, Xialing and Katy object, Wenwu imprisons them. Also incarcerated is former actor Trevor Slattery (Sir Ben Kingsley), whom the Ten Rings imprisoned for impersonating Wenwu, as The Mandarin, and his hundun companion Morris, who offers to guide them to Ta Lo. The group escapes and travel to Ta Lo, which exists in a separate dimension with various Chinese mythological creatures. They meet Ying Nan (Michelle Yeoh), Li's sister, who explains the history of Ta Lo: thousands of years ago, the village was attacked by the soul-consuming Dweller-in-Darkness and its minions but was saved by a Chinese dragon called the Great Protector who helped seal the Dark Gate to the Dweller's world. According to Nan, the Dweller-in-Darkness has been influencing Wenwu to believe Li is still alive so that he will open the Gate. Shang-Chi, Xialing, and Katy join the villagers in training and preparing for Wenwu's arrival, using outfits and weapons crafted from dragon scales. Wenwu and the Ten Rings arrive and attack. Wenwu overpowers Shang-Chi and forces him into the nearby lake, then destroys the Gate with the rings. Some of Dweller's minions escape, and the villagers join forces with the Ten Rings to fight them. Shang-Chi is revived by the Great Protector, which leaves the lake to battle the minions. Wenwu and Shang-Chi fight once more, with Shang-Chi gaining the upper hand, but he chooses to spare his father. The Dweller-in-Darkness escapes the weakened Gate and attacks Shang-Chi. Wenwu saves his son, bequeathing him the rings before being killed by the Dweller-in-Darkness. The Dweller-in-Darkness is eventually killed by the combined efforts of Shang-Chi, the Great Protector, Xialing, and Katy. Following the battle, Shang-Chi and Katy return to San Francisco where they are summoned by the sorcerer Wong (Benedict Wong) to the Sanctum Sanctorum. In a mid-credits scene, Wong introduces Shang-Chi and Katy to Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) and Carol Danvers (Brie Larson). They discover that the ten rings are emitting a mysterious signal. In a post-credits scene, Xialing becomes the new leader of the Ten Rings after telling Shang-Chi that she was going to disband the organisation. Also starring Ronny Chieng as Jon Jon, Tsai Chin as Waipo, Yuen Wah as Master Guang Bo, Jodi Long as Mrs. Chen, Dallas Liu as Ruihua, Paul He as Chancellor Hui and Tsai Chin as Katy's grandmother, with the voice of Tim Roth as Abomination. Liu is suited nicely as the lead hero, Awkwafina is loveable as the hero's high-spirited best friend, Leung is interesting as the half-hero half-villain father, and there is good support from the likes of Yeoh and Kingsley. It is a simple story of a young man who must confront his past and use his mastery in weaponry-based Kung Fu to save the world, the highlights are the fight on the speeding bus and the final epic battle featuring dragons and mythical monsters, I agree the excellent special effects may swamp a lot of what is going on, but a well-written script, many fast-paces sequences, moments of humour, and nods to past martial arts movies help to smooth things out, all together it is an entertaining superhero fantasy action. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects.

168,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,A silly goofy boarderline cartoon,"This should be considered an animated film based on the amount of terrible cartoon like CGI utilized. From ""floppy"" animation used in place of human stunt people for MANY of the fight scenes (sorry, but martial arts are a lot less impressive when there are no actual people involved) to the terrible Avatar looking backgrounds and even cars / buses. For the amount of money put into a film like this I would hope the effects would be better than an episode of Game of Thrones, but instead they looked like the Matrix part 2.

The storyline is something new for me, I never heard about these stories and legends before. But now I plan to do that way more often. It was a little disappointing that all the 'good' main characters survived without a scratch. Of course I am happy that they will return in these movies in the future, but it makes it less dramatic and realistic.

Happy that the comedic timing in certain scenes isn't overdone and it plays out to be a little more serious. The Mandarin in the movie by far the best acted out character and the choreography of the martial arts is on point. The movie is probably about 15 mins too long just when you think ""oh it's finishing up"" there's more. There is a notable difference in the second act with the story going more rapid and pacing is definitely the movies biggest flaw. Acting wise it's cool, nothing amazing or something you haven't seen before.If you're familiar with marvel it's the exact same model as some of the other movies with it being about family (Thor, Black Widow).Wanna have a good time with the family or just a decent watchable movie?

All the actors are very likeable, especially Leung, who does a great job of making sure Wenwu doesn't descend into a caricature of a bad guy, but truly feels like a misguided father. Some great cameos also round everything out and it's always great to see Michelle Yeoh.While a bit slow in some parts, the martial arts scenes and action near the end are great, without being overwhelming - certainly up there with 'Hero' & 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'.

That's what it looked like to me, but later it turned out that he was a strong arm for Shang-Chi's dad, Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung). Wouldn't Wenwu be just a little PO'ed if the Razor guy actually hurt his son?Then there's the question of Shang-Chi's martial arts ability. After dispatching how many dozen fighters on the bus and on the scaffold, he gets blown out by his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) at the Golden Daggers Club. How? Similarly, Auntie Nan (Michelle Yeoh) doesn't have much trouble showing him what's what with her more elegant, flowing martial arts style. It seemed like Shang-Chi's ability got progressively worse as time went by, until the finale required him to rise to the occasion. And I can't for the life of me figure out why film makers can't make sure characters who use a bow and arrow get it right with the grip. When Katy (Awkwafina) takes up her archery practice, she squeezes the nock of the arrow between her fingertips, which is almost impossible with a high tension bow. The proper method calls for placing the nock between the index and middle finger on the bowstring. It allows for more accuracy, and you don't wind up with the arrow swinging up and down on the bow as you're trying to release it.Well, I guess that's enough ranting. The CGI special effects were quite astounding, I especially liked the colorful mythical creatures of Ta Lo. The martial arts sequences were exceptionally well choreographed as well, even though we know what's seen on screen is impossible in real life. The story itself was very much a rehash of hundreds of martial art film plots, which almost always seek vengeance for the death of a father, mother, mentor, master, take your pick. Even with that, it's an entertaining picture to watch, as the Ten Rings concept is given time to play out here, and in the expected sequel as well. As for that, the very final after, after, after credits scene appears to position Xu Xialing as the replacement for her father Wenwu at the head of the Ten Rings organization. We'll have to wait and see how Shang-Chi manages to deal with that whole scenario.","[['a lot', 'the story', 'line', 'the film', 'credibility', 'a notch', 'this viewer'], ['example', 'the insane', 'bus', 'fight', 'scene', 'Razor Fist', 'Florian Munteanu', 'Shaun', 'Simu Liu', 'Shang-Chi'], ['a strong arm', 'Shang-Chi', 'dad', 'Xu Wenwu', 'Tony Chiu-Wai Leung'], [""PO'ed"", 'Razor', 'guy', 'son', 'the question', 'Shang-Chi', 'ability'], ['many dozen', 'the bus', 'the scaffold', 'sister', 'Xialing', ""Meng'er Zhang"", 'Golden', 'Club'], [], ['Auntie Nan', 'Michelle Yeoh', 'much trouble', 'style'], ['Shang-Chi', 'ability', 'time', 'the finale', 'the occasion'], ['the life', 'film', 'a bow', 'arrow', 'the grip'], ['Katy', 'Awkwafina', 'archery', 'practice', 'the nock', 'the arrow', 'a high tension', 'bow'], ['The proper method', 'the nock', 'the index', 'middle finger', 'the bowstring'], ['accuracy', 'the arrow', 'the bow', 'it.Well', 'enough ranting'], ['CGI', 'Ta Lo'], ['screen', 'real life'], ['The story', 'a rehash', 'martial art', 'film', 'seek vengeance', 'the death', 'a father', 'mother', 'mentor', 'master', 'pick'], ['an entertaining picture', 'Ten Rings', 'concept', 'time', 'the expected sequel'], ['scene', 'position', 'Xu Xialing', 'the replacement', 'father', 'Wenwu', 'the head', 'Ten Rings', 'organization'], ['that whole scenario']]","[['lot of inconsistencies', 'story line', 'film', 'credibility', 'notch', 'viewer'], ['example', 'insane bus fight scene', 'Razor Fist', 'Florian Munteanu', 'Shaun', 'Simu Liu', 'Shang-Chi'], ['arm for Shang-Chi', 'dad', 'Xu Wenwu', 'Tony Chiu-Wai Leung'], [""little PO'ed"", 'Razor guy', 'son', 'question of Shang-Chi', 'arts ability'], ['dozen fighters', 'bus', 'scaffold', 'sister Xialing', ""Meng'er Zhang"", 'Golden Daggers Club'], [], ['Auntie Nan', 'Michelle Yeoh', 'much trouble', 'arts style'], ['Shang-Chi', 'ability', 'time', 'finale', 'occasion'], ['life', 'film makers', 'sure characters', 'bow and arrow', 'grip'], ['Katy', 'Awkwafina', 'archery practice', 'nock', 'arrow', 'fingertips', 'tension bow'], ['proper method', 'nock', 'index', 'middle finger', 'bowstring'], ['accuracy', 'arrow', 'bow', 'it.Well', 'enough ranting'], ['CGI', 'special effects', 'creatures of Ta Lo'], ['arts sequences', 'screen', 'real life'], ['story', 'rehash of hundreds', 'art film plots', 'seek vengeance', 'death', 'father', 'mother', 'mentor', 'master', 'pick'], ['entertaining picture', 'Ten Rings concept', 'time', 'expected sequel'], ['credits scene', 'position Xu Xialing', 'replacement', 'father Wenwu', 'head', 'Ten Rings organization'], ['Shang-Chi manages', 'whole scenario']]"

In a lot of previous MCU fight scenes it can be kind of hard to even tell what is going on half the time. But in Shang-Shi, not only are some of the fight scenes really interesting like that one scene on the bus where we get that continuous shot of Shang-Shi moving up the bus through a bunch of people, or the scene where they're attacked on the side of the building and half to climb down this thing, jumping and swinging around it. Also, the movie looks AWESOME at some times, and it's kinda' like a light show. The special effects look great, and the movie is well directed, and fun to watch.Really the only problem I have with movie are just smaller, like the movie kinda' slows down toward the middle. There's also that scene toward the end of the movie, where we see him flashing back to his mom getting taken away, which seems kinda' useless and just to dramatize everything before we reach the big climax.But other than that, the movie is totally worth the watch and I highly recommend it.","[['Shang-Shi', 'Legend', 'Ten Rings', 'MCU', 'list', 'a lot', 'action'], ['a lot', 'MCU', 'fight', 'kind', 'the time'], ['Shang-Shi', 'the fight', 'scene', 'the bus', 'that continuous shot', 'Shang-Shi', 'the bus', 'a bunch', 'the scene', 'the side', 'the building', 'half', 'this thing', 'jumping'], ['the movie', 'AWESOME', 'a light show'], ['the movie', 'fun', 'the only problem', 'movie', 'the movie', 'kinda', 'the middle'], ['that scene', 'the end', 'the movie', 'mom', 'kinda', 'everything', 'the big climax.But', 'the movie', 'the watch']]","[['Shang-Shi', 'Legend', 'Ten Rings', 'MCU list', 'lot', 'action sequences'], ['lot', 'MCU fight scenes', 'kind', 'time'], ['Shang-Shi', 'fight scenes', 'scene', 'bus', 'shot of Shang-Shi', 'bus', 'bunch of people', 'scene', 'side', 'building and half', 'thing', 'jumping'], ['movie', 'AWESOME', 'times', 'light show'], ['special effects', 'movie', 'fun', 'only problem', 'movie', 'movie kinda', 'middle'], ['scene', 'end', 'movie', 'mom', 'kinda', 'everything', 'big climax.But', 'movie', 'watch']]"
201,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,"It's not as bad as people are saying, it's also not quite as good.","First off, this is a decent movie.Sure, there's a buttload of tropey nonsense, small furry Disney creatures and all that, but overall it's a good MCU inclusion and Simu Liu is great, as are MOST of the other actors.The story is pretty decent, although a little over the place in parts, and does a pretty nice job of including it in the overall MCU as well as adding some nice Chinese mythical callbacks or whatever you would call them.The acting is excellent, especially Tony Leung who I would say is the most relatable antagonist since Marvel's Daredevil and the superb Kingpin.However, there's some pretty bad parts too. Awkwafina does well to not be quite as annoying as she's been in other parts, but is given WAY too much credit and screen time considering she's just Shang Chi's buddy and has no actual skill or reason to be there. Especially with how's she's treated by Wong later in the movie. Why Marvel needs her to be included quite as much I've no idea. Especially considering how great Shang Chi and his sister were in the film.Lastly, the fight choreography. It is VERY good. An absolute tribute to the late Brad Allan and was a joy to watch.

205,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,ALMOST a Superhero-Masterpiece,"This movie is really good! In fact the first half of the movie is almost flawless. Incredible combat scenes and a great family drama story set-up which promises an emotional climax and confrontation.SPOILERS:Where the movie fails to become a masterpiece is the last 20 minutes. Throughout the whole movie the conflict between father and son is at the forefront and is the real emotional driving force of the story. And what a great idea for a superhero movie to tackle such a deep and relatable topic.There is even an important line of foreshadowing by Shang, the evening before the final battle: -I'm going to kill my father-. What a strong statement and what a setup.But then the climax of the movie turns out the be a fight between 2 dragons.. the father dies by pure bad luck couple of scenes earlier.. killed by a random monster.A HUGE MISSED OPPORTUNITYIf they had kept the emotional conflict and the father&son dynamic as the climax of the movie, it COULD have become a masterpiece, which would have been more then just a great super-hero movie, it would have become timeless.HERE'S MY PITCH FOR THE LAST 20 MINUTES:1) the father tries to open the gate. Shang-Chi fights him. Shang gradually wins the upper hand in the battle as he taps into his mothers skills.The father doesn't give in and continuously tries to open the gate. -If you want to stop me, you'll have to kill me- he yells. Now Shang-Chi is confronted with the moral dilemma of choosing to save the world or the life of his father.2) Shang-Chi choses to defeat his father, however he doesn't kill him just wounds him badly and takes the rings off him.It is too late however, the gate has Already opened and the monster comes through and goes straight for the village3) The father realizes his mistake and has a moment of emotional breakthrough as he realizes his wrongdoings and how he has let his son down as a father. He asks for forgiveness. They exchange a few deep words before Shang rushes off.4) with the help of the rings and the village dragon Shang-Chi manages to defeat the Monster.5) The gate is still open and it needs to be closed. It gets established that closing it also kills the person who does so.6) Shang doesn't hesitate for a second and rushes to the gate to sacrifice himself. Just before getting there his father pushes him out of the way and closes the gate in his stead. He dies saving his son and everyone else and redeems himself and ultimately heals the broken bond he had with his son....aaaaand scene.Now THAT in my eyes would be a worthy arc for the father and emotional climax which pays off the great build up the movie does.","[['This movie'], ['fact', 'the first half', 'the movie'], ['Incredible combat', 'a great family', 'drama', 'story', 'an emotional climax', 'confrontation.SPOILERS', 'the movie', 'a masterpiece'], ['the whole movie', 'the conflict', 'father', 'son', 'the forefront', 'force', 'the story'], ['a great idea', 'a superhero movie', 'relatable topic.There', 'an important line', 'foreshadowing', 'Shang', 'the evening', 'the final battle', 'father-'], ['a strong statement', 'a setup.But', 'the climax', 'the movie', 'a fight', 'the father', 'pure', 'bad luck couple', 'a random', 'monster.A', 'HUGE MISSED OPPORTUNITYIf', 'the emotional conflict', 'the father', 'son', 'dynamic', 'the climax', 'the movie', 'COULD', 'a masterpiece', 'a great super-hero movie', 'timeless.HERE', 'MY PITCH FOR THE LAST', 'MINUTES:1', 'the father', 'the gate'], [], ['Shang', 'the upper hand', 'the battle', 'father', 'the gate'], [], ['Shang-Chi', 'the moral dilemma', 'the world', 'the life', 'father.2', 'Shang-Chi', 'father', 'him.It', 'the gate', 'the monster', 'the village3', 'The father', 'mistake', 'a moment', 'emotional breakthrough', 'son', 'a father'], ['forgiveness'], ['Shang', 'the help', 'the village', 'Shang-Chi', 'Monster.5', 'The gate'], ['the person', 'Shang', 'the gate'], ['father', 'the way', 'the gate', 'stead'], ['son', 'everyone', 'the broken bond', 'son', '....', 'aaaaand', 'scene.Now', 'THAT', 'a worthy arc', 'the father', 'emotional climax', 'the great build', 'the movie']]","[['movie'], ['fact', 'first half', 'movie'], ['combat scenes', 'family drama story', 'emotional climax and confrontation.SPOILERS', 'movie', 'masterpiece', 'minutes'], ['whole movie', 'conflict between father', 'son', 'forefront', 'force', 'story'], ['great idea', 'superhero movie', 'relatable topic.There', 'line of foreshadowing', 'Shang', 'evening', 'final battle', 'father-'], ['strong statement', 'setup.But', 'climax', 'movie', 'fight', 'dragons', 'father dies', 'pure', 'couple of scenes', 'random monster.A HUGE MISSED OPPORTUNITYIf', 'emotional conflict', 'father', 'son dynamic', 'climax', 'movie', 'COULD', 'masterpiece', 'great super-hero movie', 'timeless.HERE', 'MY PITCH FOR THE LAST', 'MINUTES:1', 'father', 'gate'], ['Shang-Chi fights'], ['Shang', 'upper hand', 'battle', 'mothers', 'father', 'tries', 'gate'], ['-If'], ['Shang-Chi', 'moral dilemma', 'world', 'life', 'father.2', 'Shang-Chi choses', 'father', 'rings off him.It', 'gate', 'monster', 'village3', 'father', 'mistake', 'moment', 'emotional breakthrough', 'wrongdoings', 'son', 'father'], ['forgiveness'], ['words before Shang rushes', 'help', 'rings', 'village', 'Shang-Chi manages', 'Monster.5', 'gate'], ['person', 'Shang', 'rushes', 'gate'], ['father', 'way', 'gate', 'stead'], ['son and everyone', 'heals', 'broken bond', 'son .... aaaaand scene.Now THAT', 'eyes', 'worthy arc', 'father', 'emotional climax', 'great build', 'movie']]"

This one takes one of their lesser known characters, martial artist Shang-chi. And gives him a film of his own.This is not a jumping on point to Marvel movies, as pre knowledge of some other ones will help.Shang-Chi lives in America. He has a past he thought he left behind. He enjoys karaoke with his best friend (Awkwafina) and he just lives. He has martial arts movie posters on his bedroom wall.But then his past catches up with him and he is forced to fight. Head across the world. Discover his past. And his destiny...Like the Black Panther film, this does a good job of showing this world outside of America. It's very stylish in representing it's culture and has some great art direction. It does manage to get a lot of exposition in without being overwhelmed by it, which is not something all comic book movies that have to do that manage.Awkwafina is quite entertaining playing a character who could easily be very annoying. The first action set piece is terrific, original gripping and really well done.And all in all, it does succeed by being a little bit different to what has come before.There is an entertaining surprise as well. Which succeeds in doing some good continuity.Minor quibbles: it's ten minutes too long. My attention did wander during some of the quieter moments and scenes of people talking. One flashback is a bit extraneous. The character of his sister ends up being rather underused.And outside of the first set piece I mentioned, they forgot to put any other bits of jeopardy in here. Of the other two set pieces, the first doesn't carry any because you don't believe people are going to get hurt. And the final big battle set piece is yet another of these.

216,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,"With Shang-Chi, Marvel presents their first Asian superhero in a good and cultural way.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a new superhero movie in the Marvel film series. The film is directed and written in part by Destin Daniel Cretton, the director of Short Term 12 and Just Mercy.The film is about Shaun (Simu Liu), who tries to put his past behind him and just wants to enjoy his life with his best friend Katy (Awkwafina). When the mysterious organization the Ten Rings finds Shaun, he is forced to confront his past after all. To do this, he must take his birth name Shang-Chi again, to protect Katy and his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) from the actions of the Ten Rings and their leader Xu WenWu the Mandarin (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) who is also Shaun. His father.This film is Marvel's first superhero film starring an Asian actor. Furthermore, with this film they also bring out the Asian culture and fighting styles well. For this they have used other movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon as an example. Fans of this film can recognize moments that refer back to these films. They portray the fight scenes where characters fight each other with Asian fighting styles well and entertainingly. The art of the Asian fighting style is somewhat overshadowed when characters use more supernatural powers in the film. Fight scenes where this happens are less exciting and entertaining than scenes where characters fight each other in more normal ways.At one point, the film also feels like you're watching a live-action mix of the Asian animation shows Pokémon and Avatar: The Last Airbender. These scenes provide some extra comedy and are especially more entertaining for younger viewers. The movies and costumes of the film cast also help with the emergence of Asian culture in the film. The visual effects are also put to good use in the film. Except for a few scenes, it can be seen that they have used a green screen for the background, but fortunately this is not disturbing in the film. Creatures can also be returned before the start of the film. A bit redundant on a few action scenes with 3D effects in the film.The acting is well done by the film cast. Simu Liu took to Twitter to ask Marvel to play the part, with both parties quickly making a good deal. Simu Liu comes across as good and charismatic as the lead of the film and further conveys the action sequences beautifully. Along with Awkwafina, he also has good chemistry in the film and together provide good appropriate humor. The comedy also doesn't overshadow all the dramatic aspects in the film, which sometimes does happen. Tony Chiu-Wai Leung also portrays the villain of the film in a good and sympathetic way, so that as a viewer you understand why he does what he is doing to me. This film is also only his first English-language role in an American film. Although this is only his first time, he still delivers good and appropriate acting. Meng'er Zhang does not get that much time in the film, but a bit less good or present in the film.","[['Shang-Chi', 'Legend', 'Ten Rings', 'a new superhero', 'movie', 'Marvel', 'film', 'series'], ['The film', 'part', 'Destin Daniel Cretton', 'the director', 'Short Term', 'Just Mercy.The', 'film', 'Shaun', 'Simu Liu', 'past', 'life', 'friend', 'Katy', 'Awkwafina'], ['the mysterious organization', 'Ten Rings', 'Shaun', 'past'], ['birth', 'name', 'Shang-Chi', 'Katy', 'sister', 'Xialing', ""Meng'er Zhang"", 'Ten Rings', 'leader', 'Xu WenWu', 'Mandarin', 'Tony Chiu-Wai Leung', 'Shaun'], ['father.This', 'film', 'Marvel', 'first superhero', 'film', 'an Asian actor'], ['this film', 'the Asian culture', 'fighting'], ['Crouching Tiger', 'Hidden Dragon', 'an example'], ['this film'], ['the fight', 'Asian fighting'], ['The art', 'the Asian fighting', 'style', 'the film'], ['Fight', 'point', 'the film', 'a live-action mix', 'the Asian animation', 'Pokémon', 'Avatar', 'Airbender'], ['some extra comedy'], ['the film', 'cast', 'help', 'the emergence', 'Asian culture', 'the film'], ['good use', 'the film'], ['a green screen', 'the background', 'the film'], ['the start', 'the film'], ['A bit', 'a few action', 'the film.The', 'acting', 'the film', 'cast'], ['Simu Liu', 'Twitter', 'Marvel', 'the part', 'a good deal'], ['Simu Liu', 'the lead', 'the film', 'the action'], ['Awkwafina', 'good chemistry', 'the film', 'good appropriate humor'], ['The comedy', 'the film'], ['Tony Chiu-Wai Leung', 'the villain', 'the film', 'sympathetic way', 'a viewer'], ['This film', 'first English-language role', 'an American film'], ['first time', 'appropriate acting'], [""Meng'er Zhang"", 'much time', 'the film', 'the film']]","[['Shang-Chi', 'Legend', 'Ten Rings', 'superhero movie', 'Marvel film series'], ['film', 'part by Destin Daniel Cretton', 'director of Short Term', 'Just Mercy.The film', 'Shaun', 'Simu Liu', 'past', 'life', 'friend Katy', 'Awkwafina'], ['mysterious organization', 'Ten Rings', 'Shaun', 'past'], ['birth name Shang-Chi', 'Katy', 'sister Xialing', ""Meng'er Zhang"", 'actions', 'Ten Rings', 'leader Xu WenWu', 'Mandarin', 'Tony Chiu-Wai Leung', 'Shaun'], ['father.This film', 'Marvel', 'superhero film', 'Asian actor'], ['film', 'Asian culture', 'fighting styles'], ['movies like Crouching Tiger', 'Hidden Dragon', 'example'], ['Fans', 'film', 'moments', 'films'], ['fight scenes', 'characters', 'fighting styles'], ['art', 'fighting style', 'characters', 'supernatural powers', 'film'], ['Fight scenes', 'scenes', 'characters', 'point', 'film', 'live-action mix', 'animation shows Pokémon', 'Avatar', 'Last Airbender'], ['scenes', 'extra comedy', 'viewers'], ['movies and costumes', 'film cast', 'help', 'emergence', 'Asian culture', 'film'], ['visual effects', 'good use', 'film'], ['few scenes', 'green screen', 'background', 'film'], ['Creatures', 'start', 'film'], ['bit', 'action scenes', 'effects', 'film.The acting', 'film cast'], ['Simu Liu', 'Twitter', 'Marvel', 'part', 'parties', 'good deal'], ['Simu Liu', 'lead', 'film', 'further conveys', 'action'], ['Awkwafina', 'good chemistry', 'film', 'good appropriate humor'], ['comedy', 'dramatic aspects', 'film'], ['Tony Chiu-Wai Leung', 'villain', 'film', 'sympathetic way', 'viewer'], ['film', 'first English-language role', 'American film'], ['first time', 'appropriate acting'], [""Meng'er Zhang"", 'much time', 'film', 'film']]"

You can tell the director and writer have never picked up a Marvel Comic. They way they try to make you see that this movie is tied into the Marvel Universe is ludicrous.

Not because I don't like them, but more simply because I never had enough time to see them all, thus losing all the connections between the various plots.Fortunately, this film also seems to work on its own, except for a few passages that deserve some more knowledge.Of course, like the films of the universe it is a part of, this film is all too perfect. There isn't a smudge and not even the secondary characters never even look disheveled.It will seem counterintuitive, but personally when you see something so neat, I lose interest because it will seem too fake.Even some dialogue, especially at the beginning of the film, seems so stupid that it sounds irritating.That said, the film still works, entertains and has its right emotional charge to make you follow the film to the end without ever getting bored.The characters are interesting and it's easy to get attached to them.

The story is strong, with moral ambivalence playing a part. The action is extremely well choreographed and, at times - and in common with the settings and costumes - quite beautiful. This is a gorgeous film to watch. The effects are, as expected, first rate.The script is good, with much more laughter than I expected. It is helped here by Awkwafina - playing her typical raucous character she adds a welcome note of humorous disrespect, yet she also acts well and is sympathetically in tune with the plot and characters. Michelle Yeoh is stable and relatable.

225,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,A very big Meh while it could have been soooo much more,"For starters, the cinematography and the CGI are pretty nice. However that's where the positive ends.The fighting choreography is ok, not bad but not great at all. For example even Mortal Combat did it way better with way less. Also it follows the usual marvel formula of a lot of CGI in the fighting scenes, but this time they blew of the roof with it making those scenes feel completely detached from the world they're in.Concerning the characters, Shang-Chi isn't really there for most parts of the movie, taking a few steps back in his very own movie. A lot of things that other characters did in their time in the spotlight should have been done by him, there was no reason for him to not do those things. Causing him to be a neglected in his own movie, basically a background character. As for the female leads, one is just plain annoying and really serves no purpose(you'll know instantly when she appears). The other is an over-the-top strong woman actually getting most of the screentime, which don't get me wrong the actress acts nicely, but the way she is presented in the story and the way her character has come to be and is established is just unnatural and feels like she's just someone who has activated IRL-cheats, it just feels like they took a real shortcut with her character whilst there was so much they could've done to make her really likeable and immersable for you as a viewer. However the way they handled her just makes her feel like a 2D cardboard character that used cheats to max her stats.As for the story and dialogue. The story is just abyssmal, really lacking in content and feels like something a hungover student would drum up last-minute after a late night party. The dialogue feels wooden most of the time, just really unnatural and don't even get me started on the ""humor"" which is overly forced and just really bad.It feels like a movie that knows what it wants to do, but not how it wants to do that and just goes at it in a dozen ways leaving to much clutter and sidesteps for it to feel like a coherent story.

227,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,"Loved the first half more, watch it for Tony Leung's villain","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an entertaining albeit formulaic popcorn Marvel film that's part-family drama and part-kung fu adventure that is raised by Tony Leung's villainous performance as Wenwu. It delivers a solid introduction to an Asian American superhero while paying tribute to Chinese martial arts films.First off, it's very pleasing to see the warm reception Shang-Chi has received across the world. It's a phenomenon to see English-speaking audiences intensely cheering for a subtitled film that has large portions in Mandarin. Back in my university days, the average Western filmgoer typically would not see a foreign subtitled movie on the account of not wanting ""to read a movie."" Look at how much the world has changed now.The first half of Shang-Chi plays much stronger. The San Francisco bus sequence is reminiscent of a Hollywood big-budgeted version of 90's Jackie Chan films set in Western locales, like Rumble in the Bronx, Who Am I or First Strike.The fight choreography moves from hard fisticuffs towards fantastical wuxia, and plunges into more and more CGI. The former is more engaging with Shang-Chi being caught in the wrong place at the wrong time in a real setting.Simu Liu does a solid job as Shang-Chi and has impressive moves. Like an athlete, he sells the hits and moves swiftly when performing parkour. Liu grew on me throughout the movie, much to the aid of the always-charismatic Awkwafina as his best friend Katy. They share a charming banter as if they were doubling as their own R2-D2 and C-3PO.The film's MVP is Tony Leung, who approaches his role with an award-worthy intensity, injecting a depth and gravitas to his villain that elevates the film to another level.I was amazed by the depth Leung achieved through his scenes. The scene that struck me was a flashback where Tony Leung's Wenwu comes home through his door and gives a look of concern to his own family. In that one glance, Leung portrays a completely different person in contrast to the villain in the present. His performance cut right through me and I felt I was watching someone suffer.It is unfortunate as Wenwu is undercut by the script introducing a second villain late in the second half, which diminishes Leung's character. Wenwu is established as an immortal who's fought for power through the ages, yet there's a lack of wisdom in his latter actions that felt unconvincing.Shang-Chi's third act takes a strange turn into mythic realms and loses the gravitas that was promised in the first act. The story shifts into a westerner's stereotypical view of China. We get the straw hats, the rice paddy village that looks Cambodian, and the constant mention of dragons. With a CGI-infused finale spectacle, the movie then exhausts all the good will earned from the first half.Shang-Chi is entertaining Marvel fare that will be remembered best as a cultural zeitgeist icon for Asian American representation. However, as a film, I don't feel the need to revisit it anytime soon. When I will, it will be for the San Francisco section and Tony Leung scenes.I am Asian, not Asian American.

Shang-chi feels really grounded and fresh for the first half of the film and it's good to move away from too much wild. But then the second half blends Asian folklore and Marvel fantasy to truly deliver a spectacle. Without having to explain itself too deeply the consistent nods to Dr Strange remind you that other dimensions exist and people can bend powers in believable ways.Whilst it may not have needed to go so far onto fantasy, any true Marvel fan knows this is just another tuesday.

Is this the Best MCU Origin Film Ever ?? Hell No !! There are atleast 3 better origin stories existing. But there's a lot of good things Shang-Chi does that differentiates this film from the normal MCU film. The Visuals are breathtakingly beautiful and unlike any MCU film I have seen. The tone of the film resembles Chinese Action Movies more rather than MCU which is so refreshing. The first few fight scenes are just incredible and got me super hyped but the quality falls in the later scenes when it becomes a CGI Monsterfest. The story is very predictable and full of narration and exposition. At its core its a very emotional family drama but the dialogues are not powerful enough to dig really deep and I craved for that in so many scenes. The performances are solid with Awkwafina and Ben Kingsley providing great Comedic Relief, but the standout is Tony Leung. He generates such level of empathy and emotional suffering with just his eyes, He is the Legend after all.

240,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,Marvel Goes Full Kung-Fu,"I was somewhat surprised that the ten rings came back. I knew that they existed, and had been villains in a past MCU film, but a part of me wasn't expecting to see them again, that is until I saw the title of this film. Mind you, a part of me suspected that the Ten Rings were more of an Iron Man villain, but in the end I'm certainly not all that much of a fan of comics books, and I have certainly never really managed to get into them. Sure, I have purchased a couple over the years, but honestly, they have never really impressed me, at least the superhero comics, which seem to pretty much dominate most comic book stores these days.The thing with Shang-Chi is that it comes across a lot of a well made Hong Kong action flick, which I suspect was the intention. It is in part Big Trouble in Little China (which is probably why a part of the film was set in San Francisco, but also probably because San Francisco has a pretty large Chinatown). In another sense this film was much better produced than the old Hong Kong films, and as such reminded me more of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but I suspect that this was done on purpose, namely so that it simply doesn't become just another Superhero film, and in that regards Shang-Chi certainly does play quite well into that.So, the story centres around this guy who discovers ten rings, an item that gives him immense power, and also immortality. Thus he builds up and army called The Army of the Ten Rings, and pretty much conquers the world. However, he hears of another realm full of mythical animals and decides to go and find it, but gets into a fight with the guardian. During the fight they fall in love and have children, however she is killed, and after he trains up his son up as a warrior, he orders his son to kill the head of the Iron Gang, but his son refuses and flees to the United States to work at a fancy hotel.This is basically an origin story, but much of it has to do with him fighting his father, who is the true Mandarin (if you remember from Iron Man 3, there was this guy known as the Mandarin, but it was just an actor that was acting as a cover for somebody else, and it then turns out that that particular Mandarin wasn't the true one as well). As for the army of the ten rings, they appeared in Iron Man I, being the group that kidnapped Tony Stark to get him to build them some weapon systems, but other than being a terrorist organisation, they didn't play all that prominently in the films after that.I'm a little loath to simply say that this is just another superhero film, because as I previously mentioned, there is a lot of the kung-fu film feel to it as well. However, I guess the problem is that we are probably reaching the point where there is starting to be quite a bit of Superhero fatigue. Then again, there has been a number of films released this year that had been put on hold due to the pandemic. However, I did find that this film was still quite fun, and while it sort of runs alongside your typical Marvel script, there is enough in this film to actually make it somewhat different. It was okay, just not particularly great. Oh, I should mention that there were some nice lines in it nonetheless.","[[], ['MCU', 'film', 'a part', 'the title', 'this film'], ['Mind', 'a part', 'Ten', 'Iron', 'Man', 'villain', 'the end', 'a fan'], ['a couple', 'the superhero', 'much dominate', 'comic book', 'thing', 'Shang-Chi', 'a lot', 'a well', 'Hong Kong', 'action', 'flick', 'the intention'], ['part', 'Big Trouble', 'Little China', 'a part', 'the film', 'San Francisco', 'San Francisco', 'Chinatown'], ['another sense', 'this film', 'Hong Kong', 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon', 'purpose', 'Superhero', 'film', 'Shang-Chi', 'that.So', 'the story', 'this guy', 'an item', 'immense power', 'immortality'], ['Army', 'Ten Rings', 'the world'], ['a fight', 'the guardian'], ['the fight', 'love', 'son', 'a warrior', 'son', 'the head', 'Iron Gang', 'son', 'United', 'a fancy hotel.This', 'an origin story', 'father', 'Mandarin', 'Iron Man', 'this guy', 'Mandarin', 'an actor', 'a cover', 'somebody', 'Mandarin', 'the true one'], ['the army', 'Iron Man', 'the group', 'Tony Stark', 'some weapon', 'a terrorist organisation', 'a little loath', 'another superhero', 'film', 'a lot', 'the kung-fu film', 'feel'], ['the problem', 'the point', 'a bit', 'Superhero', 'fatigue'], ['a number', 'this year', 'hold', 'the pandemic'], ['this film', 'sort', 'Marvel', 'script', 'this film'], [], []]","[['ten rings'], ['villains', 'MCU film', 'part', 'title', 'film'], ['Mind', 'part', 'Ten Rings', 'Iron Man villain', 'end', 'fan of comics books'], ['couple', 'years', 'superhero comics', 'much dominate', 'book stores', 'days.The thing', 'Shang-Chi', 'lot', 'well', 'Hong Kong action flick', 'intention'], ['part Big Trouble', 'Little China', 'part', 'film', 'San Francisco', 'San Francisco', 'large Chinatown'], ['sense', 'film', 'Hong Kong films', 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon', 'purpose', 'Superhero film', 'regards Shang-Chi', 'that.So', 'story', 'guy', 'rings', 'item', 'immense power', 'immortality'], ['Army', 'Ten Rings', 'much conquers', 'world'], ['mythical animals and decides', 'fight', 'guardian'], ['fight', 'love', 'children', 'son', 'warrior', 'orders', 'son', 'head', 'Iron Gang', 'son refuses', 'flees', 'United States', 'fancy hotel.This', 'origin story', 'father', 'true Mandarin', 'Iron Man', 'guy', 'Mandarin', 'actor', 'cover for somebody', 'particular Mandarin', 'true one'], ['army', 'ten rings', 'Iron Man', 'group', 'Tony Stark', 'weapon systems', 'terrorist organisation', 'films', 'little loath', 'superhero film', 'lot', 'film feel'], ['problem', 'point', 'bit of Superhero fatigue'], ['number of films', 'year', 'hold', 'pandemic'], ['film', 'sort of runs', 'Marvel script', 'film'], [], ['nice lines']]"
241,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,Expensively produced but unoriginal modern Martial Arts film,"6 for purely martial arts entertainment.There are dozens of China-produced/financed martial arts/fantasy films where Laws of Physics-agnostic fight scenes are as implausible as the speeded up movements. However, most are either based on some ancient fable or setting, or in a police/crime drama where Chinese cities appear more modern than anything in North America.Probably also financed by China-based interests, this is a Disneyfied take on the bread-and-butter of Chinese martial arts films. The plot to draw in US audiences is to have the two young protagonists played by 1st generation N. Americans, including the off-the-wall Akwafina with her mouthy repartees and gravely vocal delivery.Apart from that, it is not particularly distinctive, with the major ""star"" casting of Michelle Yeoh who is well-known to US audiences for decades, first as a Bond ""girl"", then in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Star Trek Discovery series, and in Filthy Rich Asians. As a Malaysian, she is illiterate in any Chinese language, and learns her lines phonetically!The lead, an unknown Canadian, is competent and Awkwafina does her part to make the film ""relatable"" to the social media generation. Good CGI and opulent sets don't compensate for an otherwise ""run of the mill"" martial arts production.------------------5/10 Social significance for US audiences.As for social comment, it is high time that entertainment media fully represent the demographic reality of the US, where 6 percent of Americans are of Asian origin, but both actors and storylines are almost invisible, only as secondary characters to a White or Jewish protagonist if they are Asian-American, or only able to seek pigeonholing roles of an immigrant, shopkeeper, criminal gangster, or taciturn Eastern guru - all of whom speak English with a demented cookie voice.This movie does nothing to address the basic lack of visible integration of Asian Americans into the fabric of portrayals of TV or film. I can think only of 911, and of the former reboot of Charlie's Angels where the Asian origin of characters was neither highlighted nor subjugated.Apart from that, the multiplication of Mono-ethnocentric productions (on ""Black"" cable networks) still does not address the lack of portrayal of non-Whites in an integrated fashion - but a form of Apartheid in mass media.","[['China-produced/financed', 'martial arts/fantasy', 'Laws', 'Physics-agnostic', 'fight'], ['setting', 'a police/crime', 'drama', 'anything', 'North America.Probably', 'Disneyfied', 'take', 'the bread-and-butter'], ['The plot', 'US', 'generation', 'N.', 'Akwafina', 'vocal delivery.Apart', 'star', 'casting', 'Michelle Yeoh', 'Bond', 'girl', 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon', 'Star Trek Discovery', 'series', 'Filthy Rich'], ['any Chinese language', 'The lead', 'Awkwafina', 'part', 'the film', 'generation'], ['CGI', 'an otherwise', 'run', 'the mill', 'production.', 'Social', 'significance', 'US', 'audiences.As', 'social comment', 'high time', 'entertainment', 'the demographic reality', 'US', 'percent', 'Asian origin', 'White', 'Jewish protagonist', 'an immigrant', 'shopkeeper', 'criminal gangster', 'Eastern guru', 'English', 'a demented cookie', 'movie', 'nothing', 'the basic lack', 'visible integration', 'the fabric', 'TV', 'film'], ['the former reboot', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'Asian', 'origin', 'the multiplication', 'Black', 'cable', 'the lack', 'portrayal', 'an integrated fashion', 'a form', 'Apartheid', 'mass']]","[['martial arts', 'dozens of China-produced/financed', 'arts/fantasy films', 'Laws of Physics-agnostic fight scenes', 'movements'], ['setting', 'police/crime drama', 'Chinese cities', 'anything in North America.Probably', 'China-based interests', 'Disneyfied take', 'bread-and-butter', 'arts films'], ['plot', 'US audiences', 'young protagonists', 'generation N.

246,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,Shang - Chi Movie Review,"Marvel Studios has gained a glamorous reputation throughout the last decade, and this film was a huge milestone for superhero cinema, Asian representation, and the studio as a whole. Like Black Panther was to a lot of African-American audiences, Shang-Chi will ignite a spark in the hearts of Asians. This film opens the door to a relatable character and I love Simu-Liu's portrayal of Shang-Chi. I have watched Simu previously in the show Kim's Convenience as a comedic character and there couldn't have been better casting for Shang-Chi. Simu reflects the combination of an Asian-American character superbly and has an amazing screen presence. His character reminded me of Captain America because of his leadership role in the film, standing up against all odds, and overall amazing chemistry with the rest of the cast. Awkwafina's character, Katie, was an amazing character, filled with comedic relief that gave a lighter tone, to a film that was a little bit too dark for a Marvel film. Tony Leung's character, The Mandarin stole the show with a vengeance. Tony Leung is absolutely ground-breaking in every role he plays and The Mandarin was a unique role he took on. Leung had an amazing screen presence and was my character in the film. The visual effects in the film were unique and I could see that the animators had taken inspiration from traditional Chinese films regarding Martial Arts, also having similarities in design to Doctor Strange. The action in this film was mind-blowing like I was expecting, and I loved the fight on the bus. The soundtrack was average, with the usage of traditional Chinese instruments. The songs used in the film were composed by primarily Chinese Hip-Hop artists and I enjoyed them. The writing in this film was good, but not great. One of the criticisms I have about the film is that the plot did not feel original and could've been executed far better. There were a lot of parts in the middle of the film that stole away from the central plot of the film. This film had a more emphasis on magic and fantasy as suppose Kung Fu. Overall, this film is hands down one of the best gems Marvel has produced, and I cannot wait for Shang-Chi to integrate with the Marvel Cinematic Universe further.","[['Marvel Studios', 'a glamorous reputation', 'the last decade', 'this film', 'a huge milestone', 'superhero', 'cinema', 'Asian representation', 'the studio', 'a whole'], ['Black Panther', 'a lot', 'Shang-Chi', 'a spark'], ['This film', 'the door', 'a relatable character', 'Simu-Liu', 'portrayal', 'Shang-Chi'], ['Simu', 'the show', 'Kim', 'Convenience', 'a comedic character', 'Shang-Chi'], ['Simu', 'the combination', 'an Asian-American character', 'superbly', 'an amazing screen', 'presence'], ['character', 'Captain America', 'leadership', 'role', 'the film', 'overall amazing chemistry', 'the rest', 'the cast'], ['Awkwafina', 'character', 'Katie', 'an amazing character', 'comedic relief', 'a lighter', 'tone', 'a film', 'a little bit', 'Marvel', 'film'], ['Tony Leung', 'character', 'Mandarin', 'the show', 'a vengeance'], ['Tony Leung', 'every role', 'Mandarin', 'a unique role'], ['Leung', 'an amazing screen', 'presence', 'character', 'the film'], ['the film', 'inspiration', 'design', 'Doctor Strange'], ['The action', 'this film', 'the fight', 'the bus'], ['The soundtrack', 'the usage'], ['the film'], ['The writing', 'this film'], ['the film', 'the plot'], ['a lot', 'the middle', 'the film', 'the central plot', 'the film'], ['This film', 'emphasis', 'magic', 'fantasy', 'Kung Fu'], ['this film', 'Marvel', 'Shang-Chi', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe']]","[['Marvel Studios', 'glamorous reputation', 'last decade', 'film', 'milestone for superhero cinema', 'Asian representation', 'studio', 'whole'], ['Black Panther', 'lot', 'African-American audiences', 'Shang-Chi', 'spark', 'hearts of Asians'], ['film', 'door', 'relatable character', 'Simu-Liu', 'portrayal of Shang-Chi'], ['Simu', 'show Kim', 'Convenience', 'comedic character', 'Shang-Chi'], ['Simu', 'combination', 'character superbly', 'screen presence'], ['character', 'Captain America', 'leadership role', 'film', 'odds', 'overall amazing chemistry', 'rest', 'cast'], ['Awkwafina', 'character', 'Katie', 'amazing character', 'comedic relief', 'lighter tone', 'film', 'little bit', 'Marvel film'], ['Tony Leung', 'character', 'Mandarin', 'show', 'vengeance'], ['Tony Leung', 'role', 'Mandarin', 'unique role'], ['Leung', 'screen presence', 'character', 'film'], ['visual effects', 'film', 'animators', 'inspiration', 'traditional Chinese films', 'Martial Arts', 'similarities in design', 'Doctor Strange'], ['action', 'film', 'fight', 'bus'], ['soundtrack', 'usage', 'traditional Chinese instruments'], ['songs', 'film', 'Chinese Hip-Hop artists'], ['writing', 'film'], ['criticisms', 'film', 'plot'], ['lot of parts', 'middle', 'film', 'central plot', 'film'], ['film', 'emphasis on magic', 'fantasy', 'Kung Fu'], ['film', 'gems Marvel', 'Shang-Chi', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe']]"

0,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,"This was Wandavision 2, not Doctor Strange 2","I liked this movie and I think it's a fine addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has the distinct directorial style of Sam Raimi with some quirky camera choices, horror elements and quick montages. The fight scenes and magic are more creative than in previous films, such as the musical battle. The visual design of the universes are very distinct and feels like other worlds have really come to life. It was very exciting to explore other worlds and other versions of Dr. Strange. Scarlet Witch has a truly terrifying presence.While I enjoyed the movie overall, it did disappoint some expectations and could have been better. As my review title states, it's more like Wandavision 2 than Doctor Strange 2. I kept wondering, whose movie is it? Elizabeth Olsen steals the show as Wanda, a corrupted demonic figure who fits the ""slasher"" role in this film, but her characterisation was also a bit too single-minded to feel like a real person.The pacing is very strange. It often skips about from one scene to another before they have really been explored or digested, leaving us with only a glimpse. This film feels like the characters are abruptly jumping between several films that have been awkwardly smashed together, unlike the first Doctor Strange film which was extremely focused. Cool scenes like the Illuminati were wasted by being disposed of so quickly. The multiverse isn't really explored beyond red and green being swapped and pizza balls being ""free"".The writing leaves a lot to be desired. As mentioned, this is essentially Wanda's story so nobody else is given much to work with. America Chavez is just there to run away from things, Christine Palmer is just there to give Dr. Strange something to anguish over and Wong is just there for the special effects. There are glimmers of character development but it goes nowhere. We keep seeing that Dr. Strange and Christine Palmer don't work out in any universe, which we already knew, but they keep repeating it for some reason, and it's not a compelling character relationship. Dr. Strange realises that he's really no different from the other versions of him, so he has to accept what he's got in this universe and not pine for things that are out of reach (i.e. Finding happiness without Christine). But he also realises that he can choose to be different from the other versions of him and work for the greater good without throwing anyone under the bus (i.e. Letting America Chavez keep her powers). Which one is it? What does he learn from the other versions of him?On a finer level, the dialogue had lots of problems. It was often very cheesy, like the supposedly inspiring speech Dr. Strange gives to America Chavez near the end. It was also full of blunt exposition, like the encyclopedic infodumps about multiversal powers, the Darkhold, the Vishanti, the Illuminati, Thanos and so on. There are times when it felt like the writing room had an extensive Q&A session where they tried to cover every possible viewer doubt, concern or plot hole, but instead of weaving the details in naturally, they just made the characters parrot their explanations verbatim, which sounded contrived and awkward. For example, there was one scene where the film stops so that Wong can ask Wanda point-blank why she wants full multiversal powers instead of just staying in one universe with her family. This happens a lot during the film.The writer Michael Waldron was chosen because of his experience with multiverse stories, especially Loki. This sounds great until you realise that Waldron has already run out of ideas and just wrote the same story again:Main tension: The powerful protagonist is put in cuffs and deprived of his powers (Loki: Loki; Dr. Strange: Stephen Strange).He is brought before a powerful tribunal of celebrity cameos with AI assistants to account for crimes against the natural order. Protagonist responds with snarky remarks (Loki: TVA, Owen Wilson and Miss Minutes; Dr. Strange: Illuminati, Patrick Stewart and Ultron robots).The tribunal has some heroic story for the public, but they are hiding a sinister secret (Loki: Time Keepers maintain the Sacred Timeline; Dr. Strange: Strange sacrificed himself to defeat Thanos).Due to having no powers, the protagonist resorts to hand-to-hand combat in their headquarters (Loki: Loki & Sylvia vs. TVA; Dr. Strange: Stephen Strange vs. Illuminati Mordo).They turn out to be staffed by imbeciles who couldn't catch a shoplifter. They are dispatched easily in combat so the plot can continue (Loki: TVA vs. Anyone else; Dr. Strange: Illuminati vs. Wanda).Main plot: A female character is being pursued because she has powerful abilities to transport herself across time and space and keeps evading everyone (Loki: Sylvie with orange portals; Dr. Strange: America Chavez with blue portals).Main threat: A female character possesses the minds of other people to attack (Loki: Sylvie's enchantments; Dr. Strange: Wanda's dreamwalking).Lazy and blunt exposition technique: Protagonist uses a machine to bring his memories to life (Loki: TVA timeline viewer; Dr. Strange: Shop display that projects your past trauma to the whole street).Lazy and blunt character development: Protagonist is forced to encounter an alternate version of a significant female character from his life to make him realise something about himself. She otherwise serves no story purpose (Loki: Simulation of Lady Sif; Dr. Strange: Illuminati Christine Palmer).Eventually, protagonist finds a deranged man who lives alone inside a castle in a post-apocalyptic realm. He knows more about the vaguely defined dangers of the multiverse and must be dispatched (Loki: He Who Remains; Dr. Strange: Sinister Strange).If Disney keeps hiring Waldron to write the same story, I'll save you ticket expenses by explaining the next Spider-Man movie. Tom Holland's Peter Parker encounters a universe-hopping Spider-Woman and tries to pursue her to find her secrets. He is captured by the multiversal Peter Parker Posse headed by Tobey Maguire and injected with a serum that neutralises his spider-powers. The film stops so that Maguire can give a half hour lecture about the finer details of the multiverse and how there can only be one Spider-Man per universe otherwise something vaguely bad happens. Spider-Woman arrives and controls the minds of some Peter Parkers and defeats them all in half a minute. Using a memory display machine, she reveals that the Peter Parker Posse isn't protecting the multiverse, they're secretly neutralising all the Spider-People's powers so their loved ones won't be in danger anymore. Spider-Woman turns out to be an alternate Aunt May, making Tom Holland's Spider-Man somehow realise that with great power comes great responsibility. They trace the neutralising serum to the Final Peter Parker, who lives in a universe where every single person got spider powers and misused them, leaving him as the only survivor. His life's mission is now to ensure that nobody ever gets spider powers and claims that ""with NO power comes NO responsibility!"" They defeat him and travel back to all the other universes with radioactive spiders to restore a Spider-Person in each of them. The end. Rinse and repeat for the next ten years.","[['this movie', 'a fine addition', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe'], ['the distinct directorial style', 'Sam Raimi', 'some quirky camera', 'horror'], ['The

Benedict Wong's character proves to be a bad-ass. Olsen also does her best. Cumberbatch is as usual. No bad things there. Even the cameos can, at some level, sell the plot points.OK!There is one important plot hole: at the end of WandaVision, Wanda learns hot to neutralize other people's magic. She does that at the magnitude of a town. In this movie, instead of using that same magic and by-pass the Sorcerer Supremes and their wizards, she tortures and kills them. Why?One important issue in character development: Wanda learns that her happiness means nothing if it is based on other people's misery at the end of WnadaVision.

4,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,"Convuluted story, just like the multiverse","Doctor Strange became a very popular character, especially after the Endgame events and had a good share of performance in couple of MCU movies thereafter. Multiverse of madness was on a different hype level, however it turned out to be a disappointment affair on some levels.Starting with the storyline, the plot of multiverse and Scarlet Witch as the antagonist was a cool idea, however the execution didn't reciprocate the idea of the story. The first half was decent, with very good special effects and some action with a lot of multiverse moments, that even we weren't able to catch up with the pace of the movie.The main downfall started just as the second half started. Too many characters introduction, with less development of the ongoing story, a lacklustre special effects in many scenes and the shockingly quick pace of the story made the climax very less interesting towards the end. Direction by Sam Raimi was good, but felt flat towards the last 20 minutes or so, of the movie.Putting aside any long-term implications, The Multiverse Of Madness is a frustrating mix of eclectic elements that at times feel more like Raimi referencing his Evil Dead movies than his previous superhero work.

There are some interesting shots - some Dutch angles and POV are cool - but this feel stupidly long for a film that is just 2 hours long. It's like watching the action going from setpiece to setpiece in a very inorganic way while travelling between boring universe with a lot of cringe dialogue.

8,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,well that was a pile of assgarbage,"From the premise itself, to the ideas of the film, Dr Strange 2 does nothing but create horrible set pieces that do nothing for the plot itself and seek to make a spectacle to bait people into trying to stay with this horribly derailed nightmare of a series of movies and TV shows. Spoilers ahead so if you don't want to find out how this is now the worst of the MCU movies, don't read on..
..
..
So where to begin?Oh yeah hows about that this movie (Dr Strange 2) is in fact America Chavez Origin Movie, it isn't about Strange (as all other MCU movie are about the title character) it's about this tertiary character that just falls out of the sky to land in on Dr Strange's life and he's swept up in her stupid story.And if that wasn't annoying enough for you, we have Wanda Maximoff. The Scarlet Witch from the previous MCU movies and the TV Series WandaVision. She's the villain in this and she's desperate to try and get back to her children she made up in the TV series enough to rip apart the multiverse. That in itself isn't a bad thing you see, as the many worlds theory would suggest the two little children she created out of her mind were in fact real in another universe (and an infinite number of the others too) but you see, we can't just have that, we have to have Wanda be the tragic lone version of Wanda that never got her happy ending, she's the sole Wanda in the whole multiverse that is without her children.Yes, in a movie about the multiverse they failed to understand that by arguing there's an infinite number of something that there wouldn't also be an infinite number of Wandas in the exact same position as the Wanda we see, this is done likely because they'd not be able to figure a way around this because the writers are HACKS.The easy solution to this is that while this is going on, there's an infinite number of others that are also doing the same thing as there are an infinite America Chavez's and Strange's fighting an infinite number of Wanda's and we're watching the progression of this version in which one version of one outcome could happen.But suggesting that to the people the MCU is targeting is asking a monkey to understand quantum theory, it's rather impossible, so why am I angry about Wanda?Well they can't let her be a villain for the WHOLE film, she has to realise before the end that what she did was wrong and repent, saving everyone by destroying the thing that corrupted her (wasn't that she was evil from WandaVision) in every universe everywhere and destroying the place it was created in the universe she's in. I'm just going to say it, this completely puts Visions death in Infinity War on her, because this level of OP breaks every variation of storytelling, it's lazy and its wrong. (oh and they mentioned a prophecy where she either destroys the multiverse or rules it, guess what she does neither)Now to the thing that has been baited over and over.The Illuminati.Reed Richards, Black Bolt, Captain Marvel, Captain Britain and Charles Francis Xavier (name said wrong can't even get that right in the movie).Guess what happens to them?Go on, make your best guess.Bet you thought they were important to the plot huh? I mean they're in all the major promo's they're front and centre on the trailers.They're there for a total of 10 minutes, get bodied by The Scarlet Witch and are of zero impact. Black Bolt has his mouth removed and his scream destroys his brain (I know they don't know how his powers work, it annoys me too) Captain Britain is the slowest of any fighter and gets sliced in two by her own shield, Captain Marvel, the person who bodied an entire space cruiser by herself with no problems whatsoever and headbutted Thor She (because of course) is killed by a falling statue of all things and Charley? Ha! He's killed inside his own mental landscape by having his metal projected self have his neck break. Oh and Reed is turned into silly putty and exploded.It's the single most insulting and demeaning representation of super heroes I've ever seen, from the use of the 90s X-Men cartoon theme (yes, really) to the failure to have Charles chair float, I mean seriously when George Lucas can create an image of a landspeeder floating with people in it without digital effects for close ups and use simple green screen effects to simulate their flying in wide shots in the 1970s, and with current tech showing that we could do that on our own in Premier Pro in 5 minutes, Marvel and Disney have no right to make such a mistake.Like I said we end with Strange telling the central real MC to believe in herself and she suddenly can and we end on Strange having the effects of the Dark Hallow on himself after his possession of a corpse.This is worse than Captain Marvel, this is worse than Black Widow, this is worse than Wandavision, this is worse than the Eternals and it's worse than Shang Chi.The only thing I will find funny is when in Chinese and Muslim Markets they turn America's Mothers (because of course they're Lesbians) into her Aunts or something, because that won't go well in those markets at all.Let's do a once over to see if I've sworn once in this and then cross my fingers that the people who approve this will put it up because I know they don't like the truth being told. And the Once over checks out no swearing and no rage posting.

9,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,Multiverse of... Something-ness,"Doctor Strange 2 is the MCU's latest balls-to-the-wall crossover event, and it's noticeably not as well done as everything else was in Spider-Man: No Way Home. The effects and action are nice, but the story squanders a palpable script in favour of frustratingly fragmented (which multiverses can suffer from when stories don't address all the inherent issues of multiple worlds directly interacting with each other) fan-service and even more sequel-fodder with its abrupt cliff-hanger ending (pre-post-creds mind you, but still).Doctor Strange 2 covers its concept of multiverses instead of telling a re-inventive character-driven story like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse had. Doctor Strange 2's got splashes of self-aware humour here and there, but it's gonna have to take some magic to become a film comparable to the MCU's stronger entries.The most notable thing about the film is how many opportunities it squanders with its many supporting characters introduced and then never really getting utilised in the story (except for one). It teases endless narrative possibilities courtesy of the last Spider-Man movie doing so with its lead, but Doctor Strange 2 teases fan service only to deliver shortcomings instead of going all the way with its promise of 'madness' in the title. The good stuff IS there; it just doesn't have enough story-breathing-room in the film.Doctor Strange 2 is definitely a noble attempt at something 'new' for the MCU, and it's sure as hell more confident than Eternals, but it suffers the same character-squandering issues as it.With a universe as vast as Marvel's, not every entry in the MCU was guaranteed to work.

10,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,Time to retire the MCU,"After months of hype, we are left with a mess of a story that is mostly just CGI blobs, some light shows and some boring dialogue. I loved the first Strange movie, it's my second favorite after Captain America Winter Soldier. So this was extra disappointing.Firstly, you're not going to have any idea what's going on with the main antagonist unless you watched the Disney+ show Wandavision. Even though I did watch it, it had been months, and I didn't remember all the details, so her whole backstory fell flat. This movie was less about Strange and more about her.There's also a subplot involving Strange's old flame, but since we only saw them as exes in the previous film, it Didn't really feel that impactful.There's also an obligatory teen sidekick, which I guess is now standard in the Phase IV fully Disneyized MCU. She might have been interesting, but she's just there as a macguffiin and has no real personality.There's also random cameos from other Marvel properties, I'm beginning to see these bits of crossover fan service are the sole purpose of having a multiverse.Seriously, I don't know why I keep giving my money to this franchise. Black Widow, Eternals, Shang Chi and now Dr Strange 2, have all been dull, uninspired CGI crap fests, that rely entirely on cameos and fan service to keep people coming back. Let's just face it, Hollywood milked all they could from Marvel. It's time to give the franchise ( and maybe all superhero movies)a good 10-15 year rest and reboot it after audiences grow nostalgic.","[['hype', 'a mess', 'a story', 'CGI', 'blobs', 'some light', 'some boring dialogue'], ['Strange', 'movie', 'second favorite', 'Captain America Winter Soldier'], ['any idea', 'the main antagonist', 'Disney+', 'show', 'Wandavision'], ['whole backstory'], ['This movie', 'Strange', 'her.There', 'a subplot', 'Strange', 'old flame', 'the previous film', 'impactful.There', 'an obligatory', 'teen sidekick', 'Phase IV', 'Disneyized MCU'], ['a macguffiin', 'no real personality.There', 'Marvel', 'crossover', 'fan', 'service', 'the sole purpose', 'money', 'this franchise'], ['Black Widow', 'Eternals', 'Shang Chi', 'Dr Strange', 'CGI', 'crap', 'fan', 'service'], ['face', 'Hollywood', 'Marvel'], ['time', 'the franchise', 'all superhero', 'a good 10-15 year', 'rest', 'reboot']]","[['months of hype', 'mess', 'story', 'CGI blobs', 'light shows', 'boring dialogue'], ['Strange movie', 'favorite after Captain America Winter Soldier'], ['idea', 'main antagonist', 'Disney+ show Wandavision'], ['months', 'details', 'whole backstory'], ['movie', 'Strange', 'her.There', 'subplot', 'Strange', 'old flame', 'exes', 'previous film', 'impactful.There', 'obligatory', 'teen sidekick', 'Phase IV', 'Disneyized MCU'], ['macguffiin', 'real personality.There', 'random cameos', 'Marvel properties', 'bits of crossover fan service', 'sole purpose', 'money', 'franchise'], ['Black Widow', 'Eternals', 'Shang Chi', 'Dr Strange', 'CGI crap fests', 'cameos', 'fan service', 'people'], ['face', 'Hollywood', 'Marvel'], ['time', 'franchise', 'superhero movies', 'year rest', 'reboot', 'audiences']]"

12,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,Very uninteresting,"It's actually boring most of the time. When there's something actually going on, it's mostly not interesting. I mean, for stuff to be interesting, there has to be some semblance of sense, but none of this makes any sense, not compared to the real world, itself, or other stuff in this MCM (Marvel Cinematic Multiverse). I mean, we have Wanda destroying the Multiverse and very, very few people show up to defend it. And that's just the most obvious thing, there's like a gazillion things that are utter nonsense.Jokes are almost all one-liners and only one really works, with just a few others which are OK. America Chavez is not nearly as cute as everybody wants her to be. Rachel McAdams is way past her primer and it shows that she was never that good of an actress, she was just playing on her cute. Professor X cameo is pretty wasted (it's like seeing a bad episode of ""Picard"" show) and would have been better if he just came in, said ""Hi, and sorry, I must go"". Similar goes for Hayley Atwell. John Krasinski cameo as Mr. Fantastic of the Fantastic Four is such an obvious nod to fans that it doesn't have much impact (and Mr. Fantastic is much more interesting character). The ""action"" scenes are so silly one can't say they are good or interesting, except in a few interesting action moments, but, in 2 hours, that's way too little.Towards the end it goes into horror movie mode, but, in this setting it feels more like a parody or simply ""so bad it's not scary, but not so bad is funny"" such as the Evil Dead; which kind of makes sense, giving that Bruce Campbell has a cameo.Quite frankly, I don't see the ""emotional impact"" that critics are talking about. Sure, there are attempts, but, they are bad, superficial, badly acted, unrealistic and nonsensical.Unless you are a big fan of Dr Strange or of horror movies, I can't think of a reason for watching this.

13,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,Hugely disappointing mess,"This movies suffers the same fate as Spiderman no way home - ie good plot idea broadly and massively underwhelming execution. In particular the story boarding, script, music and direction is very poor.The pace of this movie is it's biggest weakness.., first 15 mins race through motivations but other scenes painfully slow. Corny scenes like walking slow from the person Yoire outrunning so they can catch up... or phew a door you never saw before to save you...Wanda's motivation for being the main antagonist is paper thin snd seems to have all transpired off screen... what a cop out for a character that we all watched have an almost redemption in WandaVision.Another huge dissatisfaction is the plotting story board... sub plots don't go anywhere.. in fact about sn hour of this movie to find the 'shanti' book mean absolutely nothing to the story. Total waste of time.Intro to fantastic 4 and x men was beyond a let down... again it went nowhere and such a waste.Climax of the film ends when Wanda sees her children afraid of who she's become... literally 5 seconds after telling strange that doesn't care. Oh snd ps there are infinite universes so just go another one where your kids don't see you as a witch? Or maybe find a universe where they are orphans? Why is she obsessed with this one universe? Just doesn't track.Also the wokeness....

18,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,Massively improves on a second viewing,"I was not in a good head space at all watching it the first time, so I had to watch it a second time.My number one worry going into this film was that it wouldn't be a Stephen Strange film but a Wanda film. I was half right.Spoiler alert: She is the main baddie. And she kills many people to try and suck the power out of America Chavez in order to ""dream walk"", the act of going into a variant of oneself and taking over their body. She has been corrupted by an evil book and has found out there are variants of her children in the multiverse and she wants them for herself. I kind of felt like her story was already told in WandaVision, and this also feels like a season finale of that.The exposition, which there is a lot of, is not as bad as I've seen in other movies. But because there is so much ""madness"" going with Wanda chasing Chavez through the multiverse, the script doesn't allow that much space to breathe.There are some strong moments in the film involving Strange meeting his other selves, or talking with a variant of Christine, and being confronted with his own ego and arrogance. But sadly, they are very fleeting. And that's a huge problem. My favorite scenes in the MCU have always involved dialogues about morality, grief, mortality and other strong themes. Ex: The balcony scene in the first Doctor Strange + the Sokovia Accords debate in Captain America Civil War.The movie's themes are primarily about people wanting what they can't have. While this wasn't the sequel I was truly hoping for, it is what we have.

21,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,A Puzzle No One Cares To Solve,"Oh director Sam Raimi is up to his ""Army Of Darkness"" ways. What with the cameos from Bruce Campbell, a spell book, slapstick snap zooms at canted angles and the Pontiac Delta 88 hovering in a muddled universe. This is a very sloppy slapping together of an intricate storyline of wish fulfillment...if only the bad gal wasn't so into being...a mother? Yeah, that is at the core of the conflict. Wanda the Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) wants the life of domestication versus being shunned as a witch in her own world. Therefore, she must harness the power of a teenager who has this gift.Okay.Unfortunately, what she also has IS the power to live the other woman's life (it's really her, if you think about it) in small doses. And only if she uses some spell book. Who knows. The entire thing is this dense. Meanwhile, Doc Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is lamenting about his own life. Losing Christine (Rachel McAdams) to a different suitor because it would be safer for her. Such is the life of comic book heroes. A tired trope actually. So he is saddled with that question...in any other universe, would he end up with the love of his life. I shrug here, because all of this is really inconsequential since it never is addressed in the movie anyway. And they have the chemistry of a brother and sister. So I don't get her appeal.Yeah, I think this is an above average flick. Only because I do miss the old Raimi style. This brought back those memories. Other than that, I found myself dozing at parts. The special effects, while really well done, are oftentimes nauseating. Anyone with vertigo should be warned. And, well, it seemed very empty when all was said and done.To me, the multiverse is a fascinating question. One that was wonderfully realized in ""Everything, Everywhere And All At Once"" Here it seems to be a non-issue. And it aggravated me that in every universe they visit, it seems this crew don't address the chaos and mayhem they inflict on the people of the city. I mean, some of the damage to property should closed the city down. In this film, you see teen America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) eat a torta a scene later. Ugh.The biggest nagging thought is how unnecessary this installment was. Why? Why was this made? Made no sense in the grander future schemes. Perhaps Marvel nerds can answer this.It is also much more adult. Which was a pleasant surprise. I can tell that the kids who went to see this got very lost. Their silence said it all.

22,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,A Seriously Superb and Creative Concept Executed Blandly,"Sometimes alike but also usually unalike most of the Avengers superhero movies in the MCU, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is a giant mess. It's especially disappointing since its 2016 predecessor was surprisingly a blast; it featured a talented neurosurgeon who lost the ability to use his hands properly after a car crash, following towards some solid drama and his entertaining journey to becoming a superhero. The Multiverse of Madness understandably isn't that, and shouldn't just be a sequel that watches the first film before its new story, but its just too chaotic.You would probably find the film a lot more enjoyable if you properly read and understood what it was actually about, because the trailer was just convoluted and the film is actually about Doctor Strange opening a portal to the multiverse that includes alternate versions of himself, other people and lifestyle. Even for a 2 hour movie, this film feels very rushed, overly pacy and it just ends up convoluted in the way the multiverse works and what happens. It's definitely entertaining and really engages you, but you probably need to go and break down the story to understand it.The action battle between Doctor Strange and the octopus-alien monster really gets you engaged, but all of the action is very loud and too rushed. It's alike Marvel movies for using the same predictable basis Marvel creates for superheroes, meaning big fans of Marvel will probably really enjoy it. This movie mostly deserves points for its new characters and the whole idea of Doctor Strange entering the multiverse (of madness). The characters are executed well and wisely use the talents of a brilliant cast, but the concept is just too rushed and could use some times to stop and take a breath. It's also worth noting that Sam Raimi uses lots of horror scenes and jump-scares throughout this movie, so it's much scarier than other Marvel blockbusters.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","[['Avengers', 'superhero', 'MCU', 'Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse', 'Madness', 'a giant mess'], ['predecessor', 'a blast', 'a talented neurosurgeon', 'the ability', 'a car', 'crash', 'some solid drama', 'journey', 'a superhero'], ['Multiverse', 'Madness', 'a sequel', 'the first film', 'new story', 'the film', 'a lot', 'the trailer', 'the film', 'Doctor Strange', 'a portal', 'the multiverse', 'lifestyle'], ['hour', 'movie', 'this film', 'pacy', 'the way', 'the multiverse'], ['the story', 'it.The action', 'battle', 'Doctor Strange', 'the octopus-alien monster', 'the action'], ['Marvel', 'the same predictable basis', 'Marvel', 'Marvel'], ['This movie', 'the whole idea', 'Doctor Strange', 'the multiverse', 'madness'], ['a brilliant cast', 'the concept', 'a breath'], ['Sam Raimi', 'horror', 'this movie', 'Marvel', 'blockbusters.If', 'this review', 'the full review']]","[['Avengers superhero movies', 'MCU', 'Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse of Madness', 'giant mess'], ['predecessor', 'blast', 'talented neurosurgeon', 'ability', 'hands', 'car crash', 'towards', 'solid drama', 'journey', 'superhero'], ['Multiverse of Madness', 'sequel', 'first film', 'new story', 'film', 'lot', 'trailer', 'film', 'Doctor Strange', 'portal', 'multiverse', 'alternate versions', 'other people and lifestyle'], ['hour movie', 'film', 'pacy', 'way', 'multiverse'], ['story', 'action battle', 'Doctor Strange', 'octopus-alien monster', 'action'], ['Marvel movies', 'basis Marvel', 'superheroes', 'fans of Marvel'], ['movie', 'points', 'new characters', 'idea of Doctor Strange', 'multiverse', 'madness'], ['characters', 'talents', 'brilliant cast', 'concept', 'times', 'breath'], ['Sam Raimi', 'lots of horror scenes', 'jump-scares', 'movie', 'Marvel blockbusters.If', 'review', 'full review', 'reviews at aussieboyreviews']]"
23,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,Some Bald Guy Once Said: Keep Your Expectations Low and You Will Never Be Disappointed,"So thanks to watching some early reviews on YouTube saying this is more of a Doctor Strange and Wanda movie than a Multiverse movie, I adjusted my expectations and I enjoyed the movie thoroughly.And you might say, ""well it's literally called Multiverse of Madness, how do you expect me not to expect a Multiverse from this movie"", which I agree with. I had the same expectation when I first heard about the name of the movie and saw the trailers. But trust me, the whole thing revolves around the Multiverse And there is a lot of Madness, but not in a way you're thinking of. Naming this movie Multiverse of Madness was a real double-edged sword and it really shows, by how people reacted to it.First of all, I gotta say that this is probably the most different and unique movie of MCU, at least in the aesthetic department, or should I say the most different-looking. And you already know it's exactly because of Sam Raimi and the horror and creepy aspect he introduces in this movie. And I loved it!About the runtime, I remember seeing people argue that 2 hours is not actually bad and Sam Raimi movies are always more or less 2 hours and we are the unreasonable ones to think 2 hours. And I and many others thought ""well how is a movie about the multiverse is gonna be only 2 hours? We need at least 3 hours"". Which weren't wrong, because after watching the movie I can say that it definitely needed at least 20 more minutes. The pacing is really on and off, it kinda lingers in some scenes and it fast-forwards in some scenes that needed more time, especially the ending. I think they just need to hire better writers because once again, this didn't ""feel"" a movie, it felt like an episode and a teaser to the real thing, but I still really enjoyed it and had fun with it.And it is really weird too because the last movie they released was literally 2:28 hours and they've already seen that the longer runtime still sells like Infinity War and the 3-hour Endgame which are like in the top 5 of all time sellers in BoxOffice. I don't know why they cut scenes or why they didn't let some scenes linger more. Was it because of the writing? Then why not hire better writers or a team of writers like Markus and McFeely who knew what they were doing and gave us 4 decently written movies? I hope now that they're delving into the multiverse stuff, they actually get more creative writers and work on the script a lot more before releasing the movie.It would be interesting to see a director's cut of the movie or even a Scott Derrickson version where he actually continued the first movie and not mainly WandaVision (which is an understandable problem people have with this), but we'll never see just like we'll never see Edgar Wright's Ant-Man. If I were in Feige's, I'd just go crazy with every movie and give 100% freedom to directors to make whatever tf they want and go nuts with it and have a different MCU next to the main one. And even now is the best time to do it, why not let Edgar Wright make an Ant-Man movie and call it something like What If Ant-Man...? This is the perfect opportunity for them to go crazy with the multiverse stuff, but I guess making movies is hard and expensive, but I doubt these movies won't sell. Just give directors full control and hire better writers and writing teams and the word of mouth and the good reviews do the rest, just like Everything Everywhere All at Once.For people that are concerned about cameos and think this is gonna be a cameo galore and fanservice, don't worry. The cameos are fairly short, they are great and serve the plot, and are not just there just to be there, and they have some of the most brutal scenes I've seen from MCU. There was one particular scene that you know when you see it, that trod the line between PG-13 and R, and was so brutal that if you showed me the clip of it without context and without telling me anything, I would assume it was a scene from The Boys season 3. Yeah, that level of brutality!Danny Elfman did the score and it fit the movie and the gothic vibe beautifully and there was a certain battle that I'm not gonna even hint at, but you'll know when you watch the movie, that was just audio-visual delight. I am a little disappointed and sad that they didn't use the amazing Doctor Strange theme Michael Giacchino did, and I think he would've done an amazing job if they kept him, but I guess Danny is Sam's blue-eyed boy. But the score is still good, just wish his iconic theme was used more in this movie.The visuals were amazing too, although it still had some that looked really bad, and it seems like Marvel has been lacking with CGI in this phase more than before, even in the tv shows.But the thing about the visuals is that even though they are great and a joy to witness, I kinda miss the reality-bending we got in the first movie and No Way Home, I wish they used it here too and went crazier with it.And as for the direction, I gotta say it's pretty good and it's obvious Sam Raimi directed it as it has his fingerprint all over this movie and I loved it. It seems like Marvel is getting a little more open to having visionary directors take the helm and give them freedom. It's obvious that this movie is not given to Sam with 100 percent freedom, but I think they're getting a little bit better and I hope this freedom becomes bigger in the next projects. Sam Raimi does a great job with all the creepy, horror scenes, and the jump scares and this movie is more about witchcraft than it is about wizardry and spells. I really hope they keep doing these different genres and don't just stick to action-comedy as they've been for a long time. It's a breath of a fresh air seeing this being a different kind of superhero movie.I also really liked that he actually used a good color grading and that the colors and environments are alive and that they don't look like another bland Marvel movie.I don't think I need to talk about the acting because you already know they all do an amazing job. But surprisingly Wanda is the star of this movie and some people have a problem with that? I get that it's called Doctor Strange and this movie kinda lets Wanda outshine him, but did you also have a problem with Infinity War being more of a Thanos movie, or The Dark Knight is more of a Joker movie? I don't get that people say Doctor Strange had less things to do or even less cool things to do than Infinity War, because it felt to me that they both had more of or the same amount of screen-time and Doctor Strange had obviously more screen time.And America Chavez is a really interesting and a great addition to the MCU and Xochitl Gomez did a good job of portraying her.Some reviews said that Christine Palmer was again underutilized, which I guess? But I don't know what more they could've done with the fast pacing of this movie and I thought they did a decent job with Palmer anyway. Obviously, and as I said before, this movie could've benefited from some breathers and 20 extra minutes, but it was still fine.We also get Ashley Williams of course! And Bruce Campbell is great as ever. You can't have a Sam Raimi movie without Ash!I also heard some people say that they liked the first one better, which it's ok I guess? You could argue that the pacing of the first movie was better and Stephen Strange had a good development in there, but since the villain sucked in that movie, I cannot say that the first one is better. The villain and ""their"" motivation in this movie were far better in this movie, and I guess they had some movies and shows to get more development and it's kinda unfair to compare and say this one had more development because duh. But even if this was their first appearance, they still had a better motivation and were a better character anyway. (I'm using ""they"" to not spoil who the villain is but I think it's obvious for anyone who that is)In conclusion, this movie might not be what you think is going to be, so manage your expectations. The acting is great, the direction and Sam Raimi's touch are great and so is the cinematography, the music is good but disappointingly there is little to no use of Doctor Strange's iconic theme, the villain is good, the visuals are great but it needed more visuals and reality-bending from the first one, the horror aspect is fine and gives a fresh look to the MCU, but it's ultimately rushed, the pacing needed some work and needed extra time. I also forgot to say that there are some loose ends left from the first movie that they didn't deal with for some reason and it's not really a continuation of Doctor Strange as it is more a continuation of WandaVision, and in that case, people are kinda right if they think this wasn't that much of a Doctor Strange movie and more Wanda's.Maybe I'm just a little carried away and I'm giving it an 8 impulsively, and I am doing it as I've done times before, and watching it a second time will show me its flaws better, and yeah it's not a full 8/10 but more like a 7.5 leaning towards 8 and I liked this one more than the first one.Update: Watched it a second time and I think I like it a little less, I think it's still 7.5 for me but leaning a lot more toward 7 than 8, so I'm changing it to a 7 here.","[['YouTube', 'Doctor Strange', 'Wanda', 'movie', 'Multiverse', 'movie', 'the movie', 'thoroughly.And', 'Multiverse', 'Madness', 'a Multiverse', 'this movie'], ['the same expectation', 'the

24,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,Terrible,"This was by far the worst marvel so far. The plot was all over the place bringing in all these characters that had no purpose.

25,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,A movie that does what many don't,"SPOILER WARNING: I'm going to do my best to be as spoiler-free as possible, but I also want people going to see this movie to be, you know, surprised.It seems like the majority of people posting negatively about this movie hit the Venn Diagram just right of those that enjoy negatively posting on holidays as well. Now, I may be one of the most cynical people you'll ever meet, but it turns out that I actually want movies to entertain me. And when they entertain people other than me, I can accept their audience, move on and enjoy the movies that entertain me without dwelling.So yes: this is a superhero movie. It's a blockbuster. It's the 28th movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. You also have had to have some cursory knowledge of Wandavision -- there's this great thing called YouTube that has these things called recaps, you know -- and What If? Yet you can enjoy this without that. And yes, this has Sam Raimi coming back to direct a superhero movie.Even more importantly, this is the return of Sam Raimi to movies about cursed books.Doctor Strange director and co-writer Scott Derrickson left over creative differences -- his movie The Black Phone is coming out someday, right? -- and that left Raimi and Michael Waldron (Heels, Loki) to start over.From the original trailers, I was worried that this would cover the same ground as Loki, with Strange being called on the carpet for his abuse of the multiverse. Yet the movie does an early rug pull and places -- there's that spoiler reminder one more time -- Wanda Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch -- into the role of big bad.Some backstory: Wanda was born in Eastern Europe, where her parents were killed by a Stark Industries missile, and she and her brother Pietro (Quicksilver) survived and were augmented by Hydra's Baron Wolfgang von Strucker. Working with Ultron, she tried to destroy Stark and the Avengers before learning that the robot's real goal was destroying the human race. This led to her, the Vision (a clone of Ultron turned to the side of good) and the Avengers stopping Ultron and then her joining the team. She and Vision become a couple, join Steve Rogers' side during the Civil War event and then she must destroy Vision to protect the Mind Stone from Thanos, which means nothing, as he uses the Time Stone to undo her and Vision's sacrifice. After a five year-plus battle with Thanos, she and the Avengers win, but her grief at losing Vision causes her to basically abduct the entire town of Westview and create her own sitcom reality -- she learned English as a child from watching American TV -- and raising sons Tommy and Billy with the Vision before her illusion is shattered by Agatha Harkness. The truth is that she's destined to be the Scarlet Witch -- the MCU version of Dark Phoenix, the Harbinger of Chaos more powerful than the Sorcerer Supreme -- at which point Wanda traps Harkness in the town and leaves to study a book called the Darkhold, the Book of the Damned, created by the Elder God Chthon, written in blood on flesh pages (hey Sam Raimi) and bound into book form by Morgan Le Faye, not so coincidentally the villain of the first Dr. Strange movie on TV in 1978, long before the MCU was even a thing.Yet Wanda's quest isn't predicated on evil. She learns that there is more than one reality and that in each of these -- you can glimpse these realities in your dreams -- her children still exist and haven't gone away when the spells she cast at Westview were negated. All she wants is her children, but to get them, she'll destroy entire realities.Meanwhile...take a breath...there's America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez), who was born outside the multiverse and has the power to open doors between worlds. The first use of her powers pushed her parents into another reality and sent her running from the Scarlet Witch, who wants to absorb her power -- killing her -- so that she can find a world with her children and be a mother again.We return to the central MCU reality -- Earth-616 also the same number as the comic universe -- where Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is attending the wedding of the love of his life, Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) when a giant monster -- which can't legally be called Shuma-Gorath and is called Gargantos -- attempts to take America, who is saved by Strange and Sorcerer Supreme Wong (Benedict Wong). Of course, our hero has no idea that Wanda is the Scarlet Witch, but soon figures it out. The entire magical training world of Kamar-Taj attempts to protect America, who must escape with Strange through the multiverse.And that's where I really feel like the spoilers would be too much, right?So let's just discuss the merits of the film.I can't lie. I walked out of the movie with a huge smile on my face, but any film that combines the bull alien Rintrah and a cameo of the Living Tribunal with the look and feel of a Raimi film -- multiple dissolves of faces and objects like a comic book panel, wild POV shots, heroes getting slapped repeatedly and comedy mixed in with horror. Now, it's not full-on Evil Dead, despite the idea that this is the scariest MCU movie ever. I've seen a lot of folks upset about that, but what did you expect? Did Raimi make the Spider-Man films gore-filled epics?I also do like the idea that Dr. Strange continues to evolve from the self-possessed braggart he started as and the man who said to Spider-Man ""In the grand calculus of the multiverse, their sacrifice means far more than their deaths."" Whereas in Spider-Man: No Way Home, that line showed that Strange would do anything to protect the multiverse, when Defender Stranger says it in the beginning, it's to prove that Strange believes that he alone can save the say, when by the end, he realizes that he's not the only hero. When he said to Starlord in Avengers: Civil War that there was only one way to win, now he realizes that just as there are so many realities, there can also be so many solutions. He's also learned from each different version of himself -- Defender Strange, Earth-838 Strange and Sinister Strange -- the same one from What If? -- that he must make personal growth in addition to protecting the Earth. I loved the scene where he fixed his watch and bowed to Wong, showing that he understands his place.That's some pretty astounding character growth for a character in a blockbuster.Also, for Raimi fans, the 1973 Oldsmobile Delta 88 shows up. Bruce Campbell shows up -- twice. Even a Grindhouse Releasing logo shows up. Throughout, I didn't feel like he was compromised. The music fight alone is incredibly inventive, as is how Strange makes his way back to Earth despite being trapped on a ruined world.Perhaps most moving is a line that a certain wheelchair-bound hero says in the film: ""Just because someone stumbles and loses their way, doesn't mean they are lost forever."" That's an important message to understand. So is the fact that America has two mothers, a fact directly from the comic book and presented as such: it's just an ordinary way of life. As for America, her look and powers have emerged directly from the comics and work perfectly within the film, as she shows by the end that she may be smarter than any of the adults locked in this battle.I'd hope that even non-comic fans give this a chance. It's a visual-filled odyssey through worlds of magic and I had so much fun throughout. It did what all good films should: it made me forget life for a fleeting moment -- something needed more than ever -- and gave me joy.You can't ask for more than that, even if you rarely get it.","[['SPOILER WARNING', 'this movie', 'the majority', 'this movie', 'Venn Diagram'], [], ['audience', 'a superhero movie'], ['a blockbuster'], ['the 28th movie', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe'],

40,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,Entertaining but expected more,"The original runtime of this movie was rumoured to be around 3 hours and it has been cut down to 2 and I think that has really affected this film. The film works almost like Infinity War in the sense that it's one big action scene after the other but not as effective. Sam Raimi being the director, it does feel a bit different from the usual MCU outing. The visuals and some of the stylistic choices do look better than an average MCU movie. The score by Danny Elfman works really well and clearly makes you feel it's not the usual MCU flair. But that alone doesn't make it a better film than those that follow such tropes. Even with those differences from usual MCU films overall, this film still feels it's MCU. Considering Raimi didn't even know what the ending was while shooting it makes sense.The antagonist of the film Wanda has the same issue that Khaleesi had in Game of Thrones season 8. We know their character arc could definitely lead to this place but we need a proper transition other than simply showing the ""hysteria"". Especially considering how Wanda faced her actions and their consequences in WandaVision, there should've been something more showing the transition due to the influence of Darkhole. Elizabeth Olsen continues the fantastic job in the role just like in WandaVision.Then there's also the character arc of Doctor Strange himself which reminds me of MCU's issue with using the same thing again and again for the characters. Spiderman was learning to be himself without anyone else for three movies. Each time it starts over again. That same issue felt like what happened with Wanda and Strange in this movie.Strange has gone through a similar character arc in both the first Doctor Strange movie and No Way Home.The cameos were supposed to be fun but felt so unnecessary with the way they were presented that the Bohner joke cameo in Wandavision felt better.But even with all that, this movie had the potential to be much more but the way they have written it just made it feel redundant after WandaVision and Whar If. Both those shows explored so many themes and storylines and this just felt like a big-screen version of it which was not entirely necessary in this form. Also, how many times will MCU introduce the multiverse? WandaVision had bits and pieces but let's forget that. Then Loki clearly introduced it. Then What If had another introduction. Let's also consider that a different approach. Now this feels like another introduction where it's for the movie going audience only. But if that's the case, they won't know anything Wanda is saying in this movie.Despite all these issues, this is an entertaining film and watching it in the theaters in 3D is worth it for the visuals if not for the exclusive Avatar 2 teaser.","[['The original runtime', 'this movie', 'this film'], ['The film', 'Infinity War', 'the sense', 'big action', 'scene'], ['Sam Raimi', 'the director', 'a bit', 'MCU', 'outing'], ['MCU', 'movie'], ['The score', 'Danny Elfman', 'MCU', 'flair'], ['film'], ['MCU', 'this film', 'MCU'], ['Raimi', 'sense.The antagonist', 'the film', 'Wanda', 'the same issue', 'Khaleesi', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'season'], ['character', 'arc', 'this place', 'a proper transition', 'hysteria'], ['Wanda', 'WandaVision', 'something', 'the transition', 'the influence', 'Darkhole'], ['Elizabeth Olsen', 'the fantastic job', 'the role', 'WandaVision.Then', 'the character', 'arc', 'Doctor Strange', 'MCU', 'issue', 'the same thing'], ['Spiderman', 'anyone'], ['Each time'], ['That same issue', 'Wanda', 'Strange', 'this movie.Strange', 'a similar character', 'arc', 'Doctor Strange', 'movie', 'Way Home.The', 'cameos', 'the way', 'Bohner', 'cameo', 'Wandavision', 'this movie', 'the way', 'WandaVision', 'Whar'], ['a big-screen version', 'this form'], ['MCU', 'the multiverse'], ['WandaVision'], ['Loki'], ['another introduction'], ['a different approach'], ['another introduction', 'the movie', 'audience'], ['the case', 'anything', 'Wanda', 'this movie.Despite', 'an entertaining film', 'Avatar', 'teaser']]","[['original runtime', 'movie', 'hours', 'film'], ['film', 'Infinity War', 'sense', 'action scene'], ['Sam Raimi', 'director', 'bit', 'MCU outing'], ['visuals', 'stylistic choices', 'MCU movie'], ['score by Danny Elfman', 'MCU flair'], ['film', 'such tropes'], ['differences', 'MCU films', 'film', 'MCU'], ['Raimi', 'sense.The antagonist', 'film Wanda', 'issue that Khaleesi', 'Game of Thrones season'], ['character arc', 'place', 'proper transition', 'hysteria'], ['Wanda', 'actions', 'consequences in WandaVision', 'something', 'transition', 'influence of Darkhole'], ['Elizabeth Olsen', 'fantastic job', 'role', 'WandaVision.Then', 'character arc', 'Doctor Strange', 'MCU', 'issue', 'same thing', 'characters'], ['Spiderman', 'anyone', 'movies'], ['time'], ['same issue', 'Wanda and Strange', 'movie.Strange', 'character arc', 'Doctor Strange movie', 'Way Home.The cameos', 'way', 'Bohner', 'cameo in Wandavision', 'better.But', 'movie', 'way', 'WandaVision and Whar'], ['shows', 'many themes and storylines', 'big-screen version', 'form'], ['many times', 'MCU', 'multiverse'], ['WandaVision', 'bits and pieces'], ['Loki'], ['introduction'], ['different approach'], ['feels', 'introduction', 'movie', 'audience'], ['case', 'anything Wanda', 'movie.Despite', 'issues', 'entertaining film', 'theaters', 'visuals', 'exclusive Avatar', 'teaser']]"

The plot is non existent, no one really cares (you shouldn't either) nothing has weight and nothing makes sense. The cgi throws you back to the early 2010's (yes it's bad) and they finally figured out how to waste iconic cameos. I praised No Way Home for using the old characters creatively, here everything went to the garbage.Poor Patrick Steward has no luck redeeming his characters (just like Picard) and every character who was strong once, is totally useless now. A movie should work as a standalone story, Marvel seemed to forget this a long time ago and now everything is on 110%.This movie only showed that Marvel has too many characters and even they don't know what to do with them.Big octopus-like monster that destroys New York landscape in the 5 minutes...The strong magical fortress: gets destroyed in 5 minutes.The Illuminati: gets destroyed in 5 minutes.Another Doctor Strange with the power and knowledge of the Darkhold: gets destroyed in 5 minutes.At the end love wins, noone really changed or learned anything, but hey, they can sell some new merch again.","[['a horror', 'movie', 'a bit', 'exaggeration'], ['the screen', 'a low budget', 'trash', 'horror-comedy', 'Marvel'], ['The plot', 'non existent', 'nothing', 'nothing', 'sense'], ['The cgi', 'iconic cameos'], ['Way Home', 'everything', 'the garbage.Poor', 'Patrick Steward', 'no luck', 'Picard', 'every character'], ['A movie', 'a standalone', 'story', 'Marvel', 'a long time', 'everything', '%', '.This movie', 'Marvel', 'them.Big octopus-like monster', 'New York', 'landscape', 'The strong magical fortress', 'Illuminati', 'minutes.Another', 'Doctor Strange', 'the power', 'knowledge', 'Darkhold', 'minutes.At', 'the end', 'love', 'anything', 'some new merch']]","[['horror movie', 'bit of exaggeration'], ['dark scenes', 'screen', 'people', 'budget trash horror-comedy', 'Marvel'], ['plot', 'non existent', 'nothing', 'nothing', 'sense'], ['cgi', 'iconic cameos'], ['Way Home', 'old characters', 'everything', 'garbage.Poor Patrick Steward', 'luck', 'characters', 'Picard', 'character'], ['movie', 'standalone story', 'Marvel', 'long time', 'everything', '%', '.This movie', 'Marvel', 'many characters', 'them.Big octopus-like monster', 'New York landscape', 'minutes', 'strong magical fortress', 'minutes.The Illuminati', 'minutes.Another Doctor Strange', 'power and knowledge', 'Darkhold', 'minutes.At', 'end love wins', 'anything', 'hey', 'new merch']]"
43,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,"The first MCU project that manages to break free from the ""Marvel formula""","After WandaVision and Moon Knight, this is the first project that actually manages to break free from Marvel's resolution formula.WandaVision was very different, but fell back into a classic Marvel final battle in the last episode. The same can be said about Moon Knight. And that's not a bad thing per se.Now, aside from the fact that this movie has heavy horror elements and is the most violent MCU project to date, it actually has more of an emotional resolution than a physical one. And this might not work for everybody, and yes, it also didn't entirely work for me, but I absolutely appreciate what they were trying to do. In the end it felt just a little bit too fast for Wanda to come to her senses, but I thoroughly enjoyed this ending either way.Overall this is certainly the most entertaining entry in the MCU since Avengers: Endgame. And while some choices in the movie were... questionable at best, it's really a very thrilling experience.So what were those ""questionable choices"" that I am talking about?Well, for starters, the introduction and instant elimination of the Illuminati. They were going for shock factor there, and it certainly shocked, but it's a cheap storytelling choice in the multiverse. They know that it doesn't matter if they die, because they can bring any of them back, absolutely no problem. So there really wasn't a reason to kill ALL of them.And that leads me to the worst choice they made in this movie: killing off Charles Xavier. Professor X is supposedly one of the top 3 strongest mutants, certainly at this age and experience level. And we get it, Wanda is powerful, but it should in no way be that easy for her to defeat Professor X.There are a few other minor missteps that I won't go into further here, but really I can only recommend to go watch this movie.

What I got instead was more or less a continuation of Wandavision.

With a continuation of Spider-Man No Way Home, it would have been like that.Instead, we are introduced to a spunky new character 'America Chavez', who could work the multiverses, not knowing how she does it. Of Wanda being full-on ""Scarlet Witch .""And Doctor Strange is seemingly still trying to figure himself out but not being true to that. It was Strange being thrown into the trajectories of both America and Wanda, where each offers him glimpses into what he is - depending on the multiverse.

And for some fans, I can see where that levels some disappointment.There is entertainment, and I believe that's at the hands of Sam Rami. The theater I was in loved his touches in this film. I'm not going to spoil it by telling, but Sam Raimi fans get it right off the bat when they happen in the movie. Also, the ""Illuminati .""Again, the audience L-O-V-E-D that, as did I; but H-A-T-E-D how it played out as did I.Yes, I wanted more of Doctor Strange and Wong than Wong spending most of the film hanging off a cliff and almost forgotten.

49,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,SAM RAIMI IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS.,"Sam Raimi brought a new tone to the MCU, and it felt so different and good. It was handled so differently from all the other MCU movies but felt through and through like a really good comic book adaptation. It is so unique, weird, scary, and gory that it's one of the best MCU movies, in my opinion. What I do think could have been better was the run time.

Good vs. Evil in its idiocratic form. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is what you expect from a Disney/Marvel film, stunning CGI with a complete lack of any solid story or unique plot concept...A diarrhea of pointless 2 dimensional characters that don't hold themselves with a failed hint of darkness forcefully shoved by Sam Raimi to provide a sad attempt of maturity to a PG-13 movie.Here's an idea for Disney...Not because you own Marvel and Star Wars means you MUST make a diarrhea of movies/series each year. 1 or 2 well planned, well written and well acted ones can make a huge difference cinematic wise and money wise too!

54,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,Everything was really good except the super annoying perky America. The best character is the cloak,"I was so sick of her. I was just hoping she would die, but had the suspicion that she was going to get an upgrade and be with us forever, because in every Hollywood film I have ever seen, teenage girls are like an unstoppable force. Good thing in the real world, all they ever have is their unstoppable mouth. I know. I used to be one, so I know they are possibly the most useless mammal in existence.I suppose the movie is aimed at young children, but its still annoying. Too much cutseyness. Very typical movie.

That is excellent.","[[], ['the suspicion', 'an upgrade', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'an unstoppable force'], ['Good thing', 'the real world', 'unstoppable mouth'], [], ['useless mammal', 'existence.I', 'the movie'], ['much cutseyness'], ['typical movie'], ['Marvel', 'movie'], ['Go', 'Moon Night'], []]","[[], ['suspicion', 'upgrade', 'Hollywood film', 'teenage girls', 'unstoppable force'], ['Good thing', 'real world', 'unstoppable mouth'], [], ['mammal in existence.I', 'movie', 'young children'], ['much cutseyness'], ['typical movie'], ['Marvel movie'], ['Go', 'Moon Night'], []]"
55,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,Not quite what I expected,"Dr S wakes from a nightmare in which a young girl has some hugely psychedelic problems which impact on him. Thankfully, he has a nice relaxing wedding to attend. Not so thankfully, said young girl turns up just in time to disrupt the reception. Apparently she has the ability to travel between universes but can't control it. And, of course, Dr Strange has recent experience of multiversal mishaps. And so off we go.It's difficult to comment much on this film without disclosing spoilers although, as with Spiderman: No Way Home, the spoilers won't mean much to anyone who is not fully on board with the MCU. Even more so, comic readers, I think.So let me say that it's an enjoyable wild ride but, perhaps, there is more garnish than meat in the meal. The heart of the story is not quite what the trailer would have you believe, pulls elements from at least two major story arcs which debuted in comics, as well as two of the post-covid Marvel TV series (you don't have to have seen them, but it helps). It also builds on the continuity of Infinity War/Endgame, so it might be a bit of a slog for the unindoctrinated.I liked it, though. Of course I did.

56,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,"Mad Cameos, Mad Fan Service, And Missing Full Story Magic","LIKES:The Acting: When it comes to the performances, so many solid pieces came together to bring another solid performance in this Marvel installment. Ejiofor, when he is in it, enjoys a nice reprieve of his role, adding the same honor, mystery, and values that we got in the first, only with a little twist. He is funny, he makes a great banter, and he is timed well when he is used, leading to a great inclusion. Olsen hits hard in the emotional feels of this movie, taking what we loved in WandaVision and adding some more layers to help flesh it out, Olson takes the Scarlet Witch to new heights. Fans should enjoy the character development components with it, while relishing in the abilities that the strong character wields. The way she delivered the lines, the emotional flair, while also really bringing that edge to the combat skills. As for Cumberbatch, he's the man, and I really enjoyed the take he brings to Stephen Strange in this second installment. He's witty, he's elegant, and can be vulnerable, and he manages to bring all of it in a nice balance that we love to see in our characters. Strange is very interesting, relatable, but still holds the qualities of the comic character keeping true to the direction Disney took with him long ago. Everyone else hits their roles well, and there is fantastic chemistry amidst most of them to win my two thumbs up, but... there are better moments to this movie.The Music: Danny Elfman always brings character to his work on movies, and this film is no exception. Strange's second feature has solid scores and remakes of Marvel themes and music you love to hear as they appear on screen with big reveals and moments. Props to whoever elevated the score to be utilized more than just background noise though, as the creativity with this music is top notch in how they take an already master score and make it have even more quality to it. That's all I can really say, so let's move on to.The Fan Service/Revelations: If you are part of the Marvel fanbase, one of the biggest things that get you stoked is when your favorite references sneak their way into the movie. Good news, the movie is loaded with stuff that fans will go ape for, in their introduction in this film, none of which I can reveal without ruining the movie. Regardless, the movie opens up the potential for a lot of things to come in our Disney verse in the near future and I for one enjoyed what the Multiverse has brought with this film, and I can only wonder what other films will work their way into the next Phase of the film line up.The Character Development/Emotion: It would not be Disney without some form of character moment put into the film, and again they succeeded in helping evolve the characters in their game of superhero tag. Strange himself has plenty of new avenues to explore, working towards the goal of growing in to a better person and sorcerer as he handles his ""demons."" While I did not tear up, I have to say there were some relevant arcs in this film that I respected, and enjoyed seeing those moments come to life in those deeper moments of the film.The Action...To Some Degree: For fans like me, action is a big part of the movie and Strange managed to bring some awesome moments to take their place in the hall of MCU fame. Raimi elevated the stakes and the tone of these fights, and delivered some amazing moves that will have fans clapping in excitement. As mentioned in the music section, the spells offer new levels of magical chaos to partake in, and they make for some wicked bouts of spellcasting, at least in some of the fights. Strange certainly dips into the pools of strategy and creativity, using a lot of things for weapons as he combats the obstacles that are put before him. It's fun, it's exciting, and it works well to spice up the usual tactics to fighting we've seen in the other films, while still sticking to the comic books that we as fans enjoy. A solid bout of work there.The Visuals By far, the best thing were the visuals and Strange's world once again really bringing the fantasy world to life as the journey through the dimensions unfolds. I'll admit, it's a bit CGI heavy, but Disney's budget has continued to help craft things we only dream about in mind or drawings with a decent realism to it. Want to see Strange portrayed in lots of artistic styles? You've got it in this film when they are going through the montage of Multiverse transitions. Want to see demons and monsters appear with their own horrific style? Again, this movie has managed to craft some great textures and animations to fight with. Want to see spells warp their way around in colorful arsenals and bend the fabrics of onscreen reality with some nice styles? I think I've made my point. In addition, the costumes, settings, and makeup they do at times are the thing cosplayers dream of owning, looking awesome as they once again bring our comic book worlds to life. A solid use of the technology and props, strange has loaded the MCU with plenty of service to animation and design to really get the cinema experience coming to life.DISLIKES:The Action to Some Other Degree: I like lots of the action, but I won't lie that there were some moments built up that did not deliver the punch I thought was coming. Dr. Strange had several fights with that suspense setting, the dark tone promising for fights that were going to have us on the edge of our seats. And yet, these moments sort of dropped to simple resolutions or kind of just dropped off, rather than hitting those sequences the first film did well at times. With the arsenal of spells at their fingertips, and the wisdom these fighters have, I had expected a little more time, dedication, and planning to unleash the full potential I wanted to see in this film. Not the worst, but certainly more fine tuning to really maximize on the MCU adventure.The Visuals a Little Over CGI: We know that it takes a lot of computer power to make these worlds be realistic and often they succeed in keeping the balance between fake and real. However, the CGI was a little too heavy at times for this movie that the illusion was a little more separated than what we have seen. The worlds and spells take a little more of the too smooth or too perfect movement, that it approached the phony levels we sometimes see. Not the worst at all, but again, some more time smoothing elements out to really give it that finesse.Some Characters Get to Shaft: You know from previous reviews that several big characters need to have their due if they are going to be built up. While this film accomplishes good use of the cameos and secondary roles, there are a few other people I feel needed more time to make their mark. Wong and Mordo are the two characters I find to be the most underutilized of the bunch when looking at the trailers. Sure, Wong has some okay screen time and some fantastic moments that show his powers, but there was more that could have been done to really give his involvement the full time in this hasty tale. As for Mordo, well, he's got his moments to be included, but don't let the trailers fool you... his involvement does not merit the full hype you might have. I can't say more than that, but this was a bit of a disappointment for me in the long run given what the trailers promised.The Story: By far the messiest of the movie dislikes for me is the story. No, it's not a piece of crap or misconstrued confusion (at least most of it isn't). However, the movie does feel a little crammed with so many points that several of the things I mentioned where short changed due to this chaotic inclusion. Several twists were not really that surprising or timed well, dropping the truth in seconds rather than really drawing things out and establishing the mystery. Hasty ties to the shows made their quick appearance and then sort of pulsed out, while character development attempts were sort of just dropped to make room for more fan service. Other potential story elements that were supposed to be more intense again felt bland and sort of smudged in, while other promises made by the trailer, were startling limited in their inclusion and execution. Even the ending moments to get us set for the next film felt weaker and less mind blowing and okay, rather than getting me hyped for the next film. This was the weakest element and I think balance was lacking somewhat again for what was needed.The VERDICT:
Our second trip into the world of Strange was certainly an interesting ordeal that opens up the way for Disney's purchases to come home. Special effects wise, it's stunning, a masterpiece for the most part of that animation and adventure we love to see in a Marvel movie. Acting is great and the characters that get good time, have some decent dives into the character pool to help you appreciate their struggles. However, the movie is lacking balance like the last crossing of dimensions, that though has the darker edge many have looked for, lacks the finesse the other movies have. It's story in particular is the weakest element for me, the foundation shaky that other sacrifices and compromises were made to help try and cover the weaker plot. Fan service and cameos took precedence over story sustenance, and even the action was a bit underwhelming at times as the plot points crashed. Still, the movie has enough magic to warrant aa visit to the theater and hopefully it will be entertaining for you fans on other levels to forgive the rougher elements. Note: Kids of the Marvel series are warned for the darker elements of this movie.My scores are:
Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 7.5

57,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,I really wanted to like this movie but....,"The acting was absolutely horrendous and the story is incredibly goofy.I can almost forgive the pointless giant octopus and the silly silly zombie but I absolutely cannot forgive Xochitl Gomes's acting.Whomever cast Xochitl Gomes needs to be fired. Her facial expressions were worse than what an elementary school plays 6th lead would have done.Her dialogue was laughable and her sound effects (grunts/groans), were even worse than her acting.Her fight scenes were worse than the fight scenes in the movie Pursuit (2022) with Emile Hirsch.Xochitl Gomes's acting absolutely ruined the movie and is only rivaled by Jared Leto's The House of Gucci performance in terms of cringe worthiness.Aside from her terrible terrible acting, the story line is made for very young children (who do not know any better) or very hardcore Marvel fans (who do not know any better).The movie aimed to make cannon (tie-in), Marvels television universe which this movie does but with absolutely no personality and no actual story lines. Wanda Vision is now cannon but aside from that, this movie absolutely did not need to exist. Marvel also sets up Marvel Zombies, which I was not at all looking forward to, and this film helped to ensure that I won't be watching that.I loved Dr. Strange part 1.

65,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,The MCU continues to impress,"What a great experience. So much craziness, so much madness. Similar to Spider-Man: No Way Home, I can't say much about the movie. It's best to go in without knowing anything, like I did (I don't watch trailers). What I will say is, I loved it and it's awesome.The MCU continues to find a way to stay fresh, utilizing the multiverse and it's endless possibilities. This movie rewards those who have kept up with everything, which I love. This movie is more concerned with the fans than the casuals, WHICH I LOVE. This movie pushes the boundaries of PG-13 rather than catering to children... WHICH... I... LOVE (although I wish they would just go full R and simultaneously release PG-13 versions for the families).My only flaw is that I thought the first half was better than the second half. It doesn't escalate as much as I would've liked. Although that may change on second viewing when I know what to expect. But I compare it to Spider-Man: No Way Home, in which the movie was beastly throughout, but then escalated to a new level during the last 40 minutes. I would rank MoM behind No Way Home and just behind the original Doctor Strange.I have to give major props to the MCU. I'm not a fanboy (and there's nothing wrong with being one), I've never read a comic and my only exposure to Marvel is the 90s Spider-Man and X-Men cartoons. But I love movies and they continue to consistently give me great iterations with these great characters. I was worried that phase 4 would be a letdown after the amazing conclusion to phase 3, but almost every show and movie has been great since then, with the standouts for me being Shang-Chi, Loki, No Way Home, Moon Knight and now MoM.

66,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,Sam Raimi could have done better if they gave him more wiggle room.,"So I heard that there were some reshoots that needed to be done before the movie came out. Very curious what they were. The movie starts off great, its fun and funny as we catch up with Stephen Strange far more than his role in spider-Man No Way Home. The action starts quickly which was great, but then we get to the point where I feel the movie gets loop sided.A lot of scenes were stretched out and far too slow and what made that really bad was that these scenes were meaningless. If you went to see this movie with a die-hard marvel fan you probably think you miss something person picked up, but I'm telling you right now, a lot of scenes were slow for suspense that was not needed.Then we had a lot of scenes that went by far too fast, and these scenes should have more meaning than they should. There was a reason why we went to see Multiverse of Madness and that reason could have had more meat. Yeah, it was awesome, but not on the three Spider-Men in one film big.Speaking of Spider-man, there was a point in the flick in which Sam Rami does his thing to the point that I wish this movie was called Dr. Strange and the Evil Dead. I feel like I learned something about how a marvel movie was produced. It seemed obvious that this part of the movie was producer Kevin Feige developing the universe he created, while this part of the movie was the part in which Feige allowed Sam Raimi (the man showed Marvel how to make a superhero movie and thus the reason why Feige has a job) do what he does best, and of course this was the best part of the movie as Raimi put his stank on it, but I needed more of the funk.Could have also used more Scarlet Witch then what was given. It does not hurt that for the Scarlet witch to truly work in this flick you needed to have scene WandaVison. That was kinda a flaw because of how important she was to the story. She just was not fanfare, that you really did not need to understand the movie. On top of that you kind of needed to see the other Disney + series What If? For the fan fare to truly hit you. Not that important but that fan fare is why a lot of people what to see this particular entry in the marvel cinematic universe, right?Don't let me discourage you form seeing it. It's good, and I'm glad I saw it once, but it does not feel like something I going to want to watch 100 times before it leaves theatres.","[['the movie'], [], ['The movie', 'fun', 'Stephen Strange', 'role', 'Way Home'], ['The action', 'the point', 'the movie', 'loop sided.A', 'lot'], ['this movie', 'a die-hard marvel', 'fan', 'something', 'person', 'a lot', 'suspense', 'a lot', 'meaning'], ['a reason', 'Multiverse', 'Madness', 'reason', 'meat'], ['Spider-Men', 'film', 'big.Speaking', 'Spider-man', 'a point', 'the flick', 'Sam Rami', 'thing', 'the point', 'this movie', 'Dr'], ['Strange', 'Evil Dead'], ['something', 'a marvel movie'], ['this part', 'the movie', 'producer', 'Kevin Feige', 'the universe', 'this part', 'the movie', 'the part', 'Feige', 'Sam Raimi', 'the man', 'Marvel', 'a superhero', 'movie', 'the reason', 'Feige', 'a job', 'course', 'part', 'the movie', 'Raimi', 'stank', 'the funk.Could', 'Scarlet Witch'], ['Scarlet', 'witch', 'work', 'this flick', 'scene', 'WandaVison'], ['a flaw', 'the story'], ['the movie'], ['top', 'kind', 'Disney +', 'series'], ['the fan', 'fare'], ['that fan', 'fare', 'a lot', 'this particular entry', 'the marvel', 'cinematic universe'], ['something']]","[['reshoots', 'movie'], [], ['movie', 'fun', 'Stephen Strange', 'role', 'Way Home'], ['action', 'point', 'movie', 'sided.A lot', 'scenes', 'scenes'], ['movie', 'marvel fan', 'something person', 'lot of scenes', 'suspense', 'lot of scenes', 'scenes', 'meaning'], ['reason', 'Multiverse of Madness', 'reason', 'meat'], ['Spider-Men', 'film big.Speaking', 'Spider-man', 'point', 'flick', 'Sam Rami', 'thing', 'point', 'movie', 'Dr'], ['Strange', 'Evil Dead'], ['something', 'marvel movie'], ['part', 'movie', 'producer Kevin Feige', 'universe', 'part', 'movie', 'part', 'Feige', 'Sam Raimi', 'man', 'Marvel', 'superhero movie', 'reason', 'Feige', 'job', 'course', 'part', 'movie as Raimi', 'stank', 'funk.Could', 'Scarlet Witch'], ['Scarlet witch', 'work', 'flick', 'scene WandaVison'], ['flaw', 'story'], ['movie'], ['top', 'kind', 'Disney + series'], ['fan fare'], ['fan fare', 'lot of people', 'particular entry', 'marvel', 'cinematic universe'], ['something', 'times', 'theatres']]"

70,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,Prepare to be ensorcelled...,"Initially then ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" was not a movie that I was planning to spend a cinema ticket admission on, but I ended up doing so any way, as I went to watch the movie with my family. And while I am not overly keen on superhero movies, then Marvel does tend to pump out entertaining movies, so I figured why not.Regardless, then I would have ended up watching ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" any how, be it on streaming service down the road or in the cinema I suppose. And let me just be the first to say that writer Michael Waldron's 2022 take on the ""Dr. Strange"" character and storyline made it worth sitting down in the cinema to watch. The storyline told here was really good, in fact, it was actually the most enjoyable of all Marvel's movies so far for me. So thumbs up to writer Michael Waldron and director Sam Raimi for that accomplishment.I really enjoyed the storyline told in ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"", as it was more than just another run-of-the-mill superhero movie where it is the main superhero against one or more villains. Sure, that element was also present here, but the storyline told here offered so much more than just that, in terms of character development, subplots and world building. And the whole thing with the Scarlett Witch was just spot on, I really loved that aspect of the storyline.What worked so well here for me was a combination of the storyline, the acting performances, the visual effects and also the fact that ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" was so surreal and had some horror elements involved as well.The cast ensemble in the movie was great. Benedict Cumberbatch definitely is so well-cast for the role of Dr. Stephen Strange. But Elizabeth Olson, in the role of Wanda Maximoff/Scarlett Witch, was just phenomenal, and she gave some much to the movie. Benedict Wong, in the role of Wong, also delivered a great performance for an interesting character. And I was just thrilled to see Bruce Campbell in small cameo role here in the movie, well two actually. I wasn't at all familiar with Xochitl Gomez, playing America Chavez, but she definitely spruced up the movie quite well with her energy and performance.Visually then I was just blown backwards and bedazzled. The visual department worked great magic in ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"", and it was just pure eye-candy to witness all the special effects on the screen. And trust me, the visual effects here need to be enjoyed on the big screen, as does the audio effects.I was more than genuinely entertained by ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" from director Sam Raimi, and I was pleasantly surprised with how appealing the movie turned out to be, despite of it being a superhero movie. For me, then ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" is definitely the best of Marvel movies out there so far.My rating of ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" lands on a well-deserved eight out of ten stars.","[['Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse', 'Madness', 'a movie', 'a cinema', 'ticket', 'admission', 'any way', 'the movie', 'family'], ['superhero', 'Marvel', 'not.Regardless', 'Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse', 'Madness', 'service', 'the road', 'the cinema'], ['writer', 'Michael Waldron', 'take', 'Dr'], ['character', 'storyline', 'the cinema'], ['The storyline', 'fact', 'Marvel'], ['Michael Waldron', 'director', 'Sam Raimi', 'that accomplishment.I', 'the storyline', 'Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse', 'Madness', 'another run-of-the-mill superhero', 'movie', 'the main superhero'], ['element', 'the storyline', 'character', 'development', 'world', 'building'], ['the whole thing', 'Scarlett Witch', 'spot', 'aspect', 'the storyline.What', 'a combination', 'the storyline', 'the acting', 'the fact', 'Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse', 'Madness', 'some horror', 'well.The cast', 'ensemble', 'the movie'], ['Benedict Cumberbatch', 'the role', 'Dr. Stephen Strange'], ['Elizabeth Olson', 'the role', 'Wanda Maximoff/Scarlett Witch', 'the movie'], ['Benedict Wong', 'the role', 'Wong', 'a great performance', 'an interesting character'], ['Bruce Campbell', 'role', 'the movie'], ['Xochitl Gomez', 'America Chavez', 'the movie', 'energy'], ['The visual department', 'great magic', 'Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse', 'Madness', 'the screen'], ['the big screen', 'the audio', 'effects.I', 'Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse', 'Madness', 'director', 'Sam Raimi', 'the movie', 'a superhero', 'movie'], ['Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse', 'Madness', 'Marvel', 'far.My rating', 'Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse', 'Madness']]","[['Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse of Madness', 'movie', 'cinema ticket admission', 'way', 'movie', 'family'], ['superhero movies', 'Marvel', 'movies', 'not.Regardless', 'Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse of Madness', 'service', 'road', 'cinema'], ['writer Michael Waldron', 'take', 'Dr'], ['character and storyline', 'cinema'], ['storyline', 'fact', 'Marvel', 'movies'], ['Michael Waldron', 'director Sam Raimi', 'accomplishment.I', 'storyline', 'Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse of Madness', 'superhero movie', 'main superhero', 'villains'], ['element', 'storyline', 'terms of character development', 'subplots', 'world building'], ['whole thing', 'Scarlett Witch', 'spot', 'aspect', 'storyline.What', 'combination', 'storyline', 'acting performances', 'visual effects', 'fact', 'Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse of Madness', 'horror elements', 'cast ensemble', 'movie'], ['Benedict Cumberbatch', 'role of Dr. Stephen Strange'], ['Elizabeth Olson', 'role of Wanda Maximoff/Scarlett Witch', 'movie'], ['Benedict Wong', 'role of Wong', 'great performance', 'interesting character'], ['Bruce Campbell', 'cameo role', 'movie'], ['Xochitl Gomez', 'America Chavez', 'movie', 'energy', 'backwards'], ['visual department', 'great magic', 'Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse of Madness', 'special effects', 'screen'], ['visual effects', 'big screen', 'audio effects.I', 'Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse of Madness', 'director Sam Raimi', 'movie', 'superhero movie'], ['Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse of Madness', 'Marvel movies', 'far.My rating', 'Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse of Madness', 'ten stars']]"
71,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,"I was hoping for something as good as Spider-Man: No Way Home, it was closer to Morbius.","Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022) is a movie my wife and I caught last night in theatres. The storyline focuses on Wanda Vision who has lost her husband and dreams of having children. She decides to bend the multiverse and head to a world where she can be the mother she dreams of...but she needs a little girl's power to make it happen. A little girl has the ability to go anywhere in the multiverse she wants but doesn't know how to control her powers. Dr. Strange comes to the girl's aid to try and save her from Wanda Vision.This movie is directed by Sam Raimi (Evil Dead) and stars Benedict Cumberbatch (Star Trek: Into the Darkness), Elizabeth Olsen (Wind River), Rachel McAdams (The Notebook), Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave) and Benedict Wong (Annihilation).The storyline for this had a lot of potential and some fantastic characters and cameos. I even liked how Sam Raimi Raimi'd the end of this movie. The film does feel like it is missing something the entire movie though that prevents it from reaching its potential.

73,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,"Marvel with too many universes and too little time. It's eye friendly, however.","""I'm sorry, Stephen. Your desecration of reality will not go unpunished."" Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor)Well, thank you, Baron, but the punishment is exacted now with my trying to make sense of the messy multiverse of the new Marvel showcase, Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. It's as if Marvel called its prominent heroes for a conference, planned by the Marx Brothers, without a drop of humor.Make no mistake, there is much for geeks here (my audience was packed with Marvel madness): gorgeous CGI, gorgeous Elizabeth Olsen (The Scarlet Witch, Wanda Maximoff, et al., just an uber sorceress), gorgeous Rachel McAdams (Dr. Christine Palmer and former Strange lover), and the chameleon actor, Benedict Cumberbatch (Dr. Strange). Should be enough to make a classic if there wasn't so much territory to cover in just over 2 hours. That's several universes, which also contain sinister duplicates of many characters. Too much goodness, too little time.After Strange dabbles in a forbidden spell, he ushers in the multiverse with versions of himself too powerfully bad even for Strange, Maximoff, and Wong (Benedict Wong). This Marvel mess is aided by the usual Marvel tropes of power coming from hands and boulders shattering, together with warped cities, paint people, and so much more. Even the staple of most hero films, Wanda's search for family safety, is present with too little fanfare because it is the most affecting human endeavor of the film.Director San Raimi has brought his chops from previous Spider Man episodes that successfully joined three Spider Men actors to more or less successfully join different characters; it is too unclear here the differences except for a third eye or two.Although hope is here in the form of a new super-powered teen, America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez), who can jump the universes with ease, she doesn't know how to use this power, and we don't have time to grow with her. Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is itself overgrown but still a mélange of images and ideas to spark the interest of comic book fans and critics up for the challenge.","[['Stephen'], ['desecration', 'reality'], ['Mordo', 'Chiwetel Ejiofor', 'Well', 'thank', 'Baron', 'the punishment', 'sense', 'the messy multiverse', 'Marvel', 'showcase', 'Dr'], ['Strange', 'Multiverse', 'Madness'], ['Marvel', 'prominent', 'a conference', 'Marx', 'a drop', 'humor.Make', 'no mistake', 'audience', 'Marvel', 'madness', 'CGI', 'Elizabeth Olsen', 'Scarlet Witch', 'Wanda Maximoff', 'al.', 'an uber sorceress', 'Rachel McAdams', 'Dr. Christine Palmer', 'Strange', 'lover', 'the chameleon', 'actor', 'Benedict Cumberbatch', 'Dr'], ['Strange'], ['much territory'], [], ['much goodness', 'Strange', 'a forbidden', 'spell', 'the multiverse', 'Strange', 'Maximoff', 'Wong', 'Benedict Wong'], ['Marvel', 'mess', 'Marvel', 'power', 'paint'], ['the staple', 'hero', 'Wanda', 'search', 'family', 'safety', 'little fanfare', 'affecting human endeavor', 'the film.Director', 'San Raimi', 'Spider Man', 'Spider Men', 'a third eye', 'hope', 'the form', 'a new super-powered teen', 'America Chavez', 'Xochitl Gomez', 'ease', 'this power', 'time'], ['Dr'], ['Strange', 'Multiverse', 'Madness', 'a mélange', 'the interest', 'comic book', 'the challenge']]","[['Stephen'], ['desecration of reality'], ['Mordo', 'Chiwetel Ejiofor', 'Well', 'thank', 'Baron', 'punishment', 'sense', 'messy multiverse', 'Marvel showcase', 'Dr'], ['Strange', 'Multiverse of Madness'], ['Marvel', 'prominent heroes', 'conference', 'Marx Brothers', 'drop of humor.Make', 'mistake', 'geeks', 'audience', 'Marvel madness', 'gorgeous CGI', 'Elizabeth Olsen', 'Scarlet Witch', 'Wanda Maximoff', 'al.', 'uber sorceress', 'Rachel McAdams', 'Dr. Christine Palmer', 'Strange lover', 'chameleon actor', 'Benedict Cumberbatch', 'Dr'], ['Strange'], ['much territory', 'hours'], ['several universes', 'sinister duplicates', 'many characters'], ['much goodness', 'Strange dabbles', 'forbidden spell', 'multiverse with versions', 'Strange', 'Maximoff', 'Wong', 'Benedict Wong'], ['Marvel mess', 'Marvel tropes', 'power', 'hands and boulders', 'warped cities', 'paint people'], ['staple', 'hero films', 'Wanda', 'search for family safety', 'little fanfare', 'affecting human endeavor', 'film.Director San Raimi', 'chops', 'Spider Man', 'Spider Men actors', 'different characters', 'differences', 'third eye', 'hope', 'form', 'new super-powered teen', 'America Chavez', 'Xochitl Gomez', 'universes with ease', 'power', 'time'], ['Dr'], ['Strange', 'Multiverse of Madness', 'mélange of images', 'ideas', 'interest', 'book fans', 'critics', 'challenge']]"
74,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,A Contrived Mish-Mash,"Multiverse of Madness was, in a word, contrived. Every scene felt forced, very little happened naturally, and simple moral conflict with a predictable outcome was used in place of character development. I got to enjoy the full experience of seeing it on its first showing in our area, so the cinema was mostly packed, and the audience was comprised of the sort of adults who watch Marvel movies and clap at the end.Multiverse of Madness gave me the impression that two separate movies were made- one, an intense race against time, and the other, a slower soul-searching journey- and then the two were cut up awkwardly with scissors and pieces of each were taped together to make one movie that interrupts time-sensitive objectives with verbose conversations and unnecessary dialogue. It feels like Marvel took on a Wattpad fanfiction and turned it into film.No one has a compelling story in Multiverse of Madness. Steven Strange goes rather out of his way to find out whether or not he's happy (not to be happy, just to find out). Wanda takes quite a long journey to discover something that she was smart enough to know from the start. America is a total nothing-burger but her parents were lesbians which, as everyone knows, is enough character to pass the quality assurance.The fight scenes were very poorly choreographed. To showcase new characters best, we watch them fight one at a time against the villain, so that they can also die one at a time while their teammates watch it happen. As a small plus, this film was clearly not for children as it finally brought long-awaited gore to Marvel. The fight scene with music notes felt forced and unconvincing, the duel with Mordo was unnecessary for those of us who saw the first Dr Strange film, and a lot of characters seemed to be very bad at thinking on their feet. I am starting to think that our Dr Strange is dead, and was replaced with a boring, 2-dimensional clone. Several times, magic users apparently forget they could use magic, like the Darkhold Strange as he is thrown out of a high-up window and impaled on a fence. Quite a bizarre death, for such a formidable wizard.Some terrible logic was allowed into the movie. For example, when Strange dreamwalks in a corpse, he is hounded by spirits of the damned for committing a mystical crime. However, luckily, it turns out he can simply control these spirits, although he has to be reminded of that by Christine, despite her not knowing about the spirits in the first place.All in all, Multiverse of Madness felt like it had been hammered clumsily together in a mish-mash of serious and unserious moments, to the point where you can no longer tell what the intent was behind each one. It felt a lot longer than it was, and luckily the villain was always happy to wait for the protagonists to have their obligatory deep and meaningful right before any critical decision is made. Attempts at horror and comedy were both injected along the way, but the horror was comedic and the comedy was dry. The movie had the Marvel feeling of being intended for small children, but the violence and death were clearly for an older audience. I remember when Disney excelled at making children's movies that were layered in such a way that adults could enjoy them too. It's a shame those days are obviously over.","[['Multiverse', 'Madness', 'a word'], ['Every scene', 'simple moral conflict', 'a predictable outcome', 'place', 'character', 'development'], ['the full experience', 'first showing', 'area', 'the cinema', 'the audience', 'the sort', 'Marvel', 'clap', 'the end.Multiverse', 'Madness', 'the impression', 'an intense race', 'time', 'soul-searching journey-', 'movie', 'unnecessary dialogue'], ['Marvel', 'Wattpad', 'fanfiction', 'a compelling story', 'Multiverse', 'Madness'], ['Steven Strange', 'way'], ['Wanda', 'a long journey', 'something', 'the start'], ['America', 'a total nothing-burger', 'everyone', 'enough character', 'the quality', 'assurance.The', 'fight'], ['a time', 'the villain', 'a time'], ['a small plus', 'this film', 'long-awaited gore', 'Marvel'], ['The fight scene', 'music', 'the duel', 'Mordo', 'Dr Strange', 'film', 'a lot'], ['Dr Strange', '2-dimensional clone'], ['Darkhold Strange', 'a high-up window', 'a fence'], ['a bizarre death', 'a formidable wizard.Some', 'terrible logic', 'the movie'], ['example', 'Strange', 'a corpse', 'a mystical crime'], ['Christine', 'the first place.All', 'Multiverse', 'Madness', 'a mish-mash', 'the point', 'the intent'], ['a lot', 'the villain', 'meaningful right', 'any critical decision'], ['horror', 'comedy', 'the way', 'the horror', 'the comedy'], ['The movie', 'Marvel', 'feeling', 'the violence', 'death', 'audience'], ['Disney', 'a way'], ['a shame']]","[['Multiverse of Madness', 'word'], ['scene', 'simple moral conflict', 'predictable outcome', 'place of character development'], ['full experience', 'first showing', 'area', 'cinema', 'audience', 'sort of adults', 'Marvel movies', 'clap', 'end.Multiverse of Madness', 'impression', 'separate movies', 'race against time', 'soul-searching journey-', 'scissors and pieces', 'movie', 'time-sensitive objectives', 'verbose conversations', 'unnecessary dialogue'], ['Marvel', 'Wattpad fanfiction', 'story in Multiverse', 'Madness'], ['Steven Strange', 'way'], ['Wanda', 'long journey', 'something', 'start'], ['America', 'total nothing-burger', 'parents', 'lesbians', 'everyone knows', 'enough character', 'quality assurance.The fight scenes'], ['new characters', 'time', 'villain', 'time', 'teammates'], ['small plus', 'film', 'children', 'long-awaited gore', 'Marvel'], ['scene with music notes', 'duel with Mordo', 'Dr Strange film', 'lot of characters', 'feet'], ['Dr Strange', '2-dimensional clone'], ['Several times', 'magic users', 'Darkhold Strange', 'high-up window', 'fence'], ['bizarre death', 'formidable wizard.Some', 'terrible logic', 'movie'], ['example', 'Strange', 'corpse', 'spirits', 'mystical crime'], ['spirits', 'Christine', 'spirits', 'first place.All', 'Multiverse of Madness', 'mish-mash', 'unserious moments', 'point', 'intent'], ['lot', 'villain', 'protagonists', 'meaningful right', 'critical decision'], ['Attempts at horror', 'comedy', 'way', 'horror', 'comedy'], ['movie', 'Marvel feeling', 'small children', 'violence and death', 'audience'], ['Disney', 'children', 'movies', 'way that adults'], ['shame', 'days']]"

82,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,Terrible film but a lot of effort put into it...,"The good bits. I really enjoyed the first film. It made you look through the physical world in a different way. You also had thought provoking characters, eg. Dr Strange who is arrogant, reckless, sensible and likeable all at the same time. This film kept some of that magic. It certainly positions itself as the more open minded franchise of the Marvel Universe. Also, the special effects were excellent... they really got peoples' movements downpat.However, that's the extent of the good bits. I really could not relate to these characters at all. Their behaviours were all odd, except probably Christine Palmer. I was struggling to relate to anyone. The best comparison I can give is ""watching Days of Our Lives"" with exaggerated dialogue, exaggerated mannerisms, shallow motives, etc. I couldn't care if anyone lived or died... I couldn't even root for the villain whose logic was so far removed from common sense that I hoped the villain died too. Doctor Strange lost his mojo. He was boring and played second fiddle to other characters. It was his worst performance I've seen from
Cumberbatch.In all seriousness, this was probably one of the worst films I've seen. I strongly disliked the characters and the story had no soul to it. The motives were absurd.I don't recommend this film to anyone except for those who love great effects and don't care about characters. The effects were superb.

87,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,Please bring back Scott Derrickson!,"It's hard to explain how disappointing this was. I loved the first Doctor Strange, I loved Wandavision and I truly admire Sam Raimi particularly Spiderman 2. But this movie is a complete mess mostly because Marvel picked the wrong director.My biggest worry now is that the MCU is not even producing Disney-fied Marvel movies anymore but Marvel-ized Disney franchises.All the amazing visuals from the first movie are gone save for one Wanda scene. Expect a lot of face close up and I really mean a lot. Expect a lot of shots going through the eye (like in the trailer), and also Dutch angles. And if like me you saw it in IMAX, expect a hell lot of skin pores because they really zoom on the faces!Seriously Sam Raimi drowns the aesthetic with cheesy campy horror visuals that are comical when they are supposed to be frightening. Some of you may remember Tales From the Crypt? Well get ready for that brand of humor. And that's coming from a fan of the early Sam Raimi horror.The cinematography is horrible, almost like watching a daytime soap opera. Maybe that's why they call it the first Marvel horror movie? The multiverse design is weirdly very banal particularly that alternate New York and the ""demonic"" worlds look like an average Word of Warcraft rip off. Again miles away from the cool magical visuals from the first opus. To be honest most of the locations look like an cheap fantasy video game.Story could have been great with a good pacing and a built up suspense. It's actually an emotional concept. But instead you get an awful mash up of big CGI scenes with random creatures alternating with exposition scenes full of trash repetitive dialogues. I believe there is a drinking game here with a shot every time Steve Strange says multiverse.Wanda is the biggest failure. She's firmly presented as the character we all adored in Wandavision but slowly turns into a ridiculous Disney fairytale villain (and on purpose apparently!). Her dialogues, fights, anger moments, everything is shot in such a caricatural way I was waiting for the Maleficent laugh. And the spell sequences, they look straight out from an episode of Charmed.And I will end with the biggest sin of ""Doctor Strange and the multiverse of Madness"" : it's lack of reality.

88,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,The much needed change of pace,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness gives the MCU its much needed and biggest change of pace yet, a dark, genuinely tense and surprisingly violent film that finally restrains the trademark humour for a more thoughtful film about regret, choice and fate.Benedict Cumberbatch has been consistently giving note perfect performances across the last few years of Marvel movies and it's really nice to have him back in a leading role again. Elizabeth Olsen gets to continue the more layered development of Wanda started in WandaVision in extremely satisfying ways.Benedict Wong is still instantly loveable as Wong and Rachel McAdams increased screen time is much appreciated. Xochitl Gómez makes a great first impression with a charming and likeable character who's easy to root for.Thankfully, Sam Raimi's unique voice and style have not been lost in the franchise's often bland filmmaking, instead delivering a film that's visually striking and kinetic in ways no other Marvel film has been. His horror roots are also on display in some very satisfying ways.The action benefits greatly from the ridiculous inventiveness of it all so no fight feels lazy and generic. Danny Elfman's score is a definite standout, really unique and fun but isn't afraid to reference some classic Marvel themes in clever ways.The film is only brought down by a collection of nitpicks at best. The CG has a few weak points despite being really impressive overall. The fast pace works really well but takes a scene or two to adjust and a few narrative beats may require a suspension of disbelief that's too much for some.","[['Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse', 'Madness', 'MCU', 'change', 'pace', 'a dark', 'violent film', 'the trademark', 'humour', 'thoughtful film', 'regret', 'choice', 'fate.Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'note', 'Marvel', 'a leading role'], ['Elizabeth Olsen', 'layered development', 'Wanda', 'WandaVision', 'ways.Benedict', 'Wong', 'Wong', 'Rachel McAdams', 'screen time'], ['Gómez', 'a great first impression', 'a charming', 'likeable character', 'Sam Raimi', 'unique voice', 'style', 'the franchise', 'a film', 'Marvel', 'film'], ['horror', 'display', 'satisfying ways.The', 'action', 'the ridiculous inventiveness'], ['Danny Elfman', 'score', 'a definite', 'standout', 'fun', 'Marvel', 'clever', 'ways.The', 'film', 'a collection'], ['CG', 'impressive overall'], ['The fast pace', 'a scene', 'a suspension', 'disbelief']]","[['Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse of Madness', 'MCU', 'change of pace', 'dark', 'violent film', 'trademark humour', 'film about regret', 'choice', 'fate.Benedict Cumberbatch', 'note', 'perfect performances', 'years of Marvel movies', 'leading role'], ['Elizabeth Olsen', 'development of Wanda', 'WandaVision', 'ways.Benedict Wong', 'Wong', 'Rachel McAdams', 'screen time'], ['Xochitl Gómez', 'great first impression', 'charming', 'likeable character', 'Sam Raimi', 'unique voice and style', 'franchise', 'film', 'ways', 'Marvel film'], ['horror roots', 'display', 'ways.The action benefits', 'ridiculous inventiveness', 'fight feels'], ['Danny Elfman', 'score', 'definite standout', 'fun', 'Marvel themes', 'clever ways.The film', 'collection of nitpicks'], ['CG', 'few weak points', 'impressive overall'], ['fast pace', 'scene', 'few narrative beats', 'suspension of disbelief']]"

91,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,It's getting worse...,"I used to read comic books, but I never had any interest in Doctor Strange because I found the whole magical/mystical thing to be stupid. I hate that there seems to be no defined limits to the powers, so you never know what these people can or cannot do. As a result, the only time I'd buy a Dr. Strange comic or catch up on his activities was when there was a crossover event with the characters I loved. However, when the first Doctor Strange movie came out, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was a fun adventure that did some cool things and didn't push too far into the magical mumbo-jumbo. I liked his characterization, and even thought he was good in his appearance in the last couple Avengers movies. Sadly, with Multiverse of Madness (and a few things that came before it) I'm starting to think that the MCU is becoming more like the comics and there will be times that I won't want to run out and pay to see the movies, but I will instead wait for crossover appearances to catch up on the activities of these less interesting characters.For starters, this movie was horribly victim to my problems of unlimited magical nonsense. Between Strange and Scarlet Witch we have characters who can seemingly do anything. However, to make sure the movie happens there are also limits to their powers, established by nothing more than plot convenience. If it looks cool the villain can make a man's mouth disappear in an instant, but when Doctor Strange needs time to get something done, it will take the villain upwards of 30 minutes to absorb the powers of the McGuffin so Strange can catch up. My annoyance with this kind of junk is only outpaced by my overwhelming irritation with the stupidity in the actions of the characters. There are a few moments where the heroes become the cliche of horror movie victims, and I wanted to yell at the screen for them to not wait around to be attacked. But far worse is the amount of time they put into telling us as the audience that there's nothing worse than the Necronomicon and it should be avoided at all costs, but when our hero hits a roadblock his first instinct is to utilize it.Now that I've discussed my issues with Doctor Strange and the other characters in this film, let's talk about this ""Multiverse of Madness."" Remember that scene in the first Doctor Strange when the Ancient One takes him on a tour of different worlds/universes, or in Guardians of the Galaxy 2 when Rocket and Yondu go bouncing through space via hundreds of mind-bending jumps? Yeah, that's about as far as this movie goes towards showing a ""Multiverse."" Our protagonists bounce through multiple universes in a few flashes, then they settle down into one of only 2 alternate realities that are shown for anything more than a minute. That's right, we have the Earth we know from these movies, and then the only other places we spend time are the Disaster Universe and the Fan-Service Universe. It's kind of underwhelming, and doesn't take advantage of the awesome powers of the new ""character"" America Chavez. Note that I put character in quotes because she really doesn't have a defined character, she's more of a human McGuffin throughout the film.I'm not going to dig into what many would consider the bigger spoilers in this movie, but I did want to talk a little about one thing I didn't know going in, but I guess was somewhat well-known among others who watched trailers. But if you don't know who the villain of this film is and you don't want that spoiled, then please skip this paragraph. I have a lot to say about the way they used the Scarlet Witch. So far my favorite thing I've seen from the MCU post-Endgame has been the TV series WandaVision. It was so enthralling, unique, and also fun. It got a little crazy at the end but it still told a great story, developed the titular characters in interesting ways, and even had something to say about how we process grief. Now, it's as if they undid all the work they did in that series for the character of Wanda. Her growth was flushed down the toilet and we were left with a bitter woman who now apparently can't let go of what she feels she deserves. To say I hated how they treated the Scarlet Witch is an understatement.There was a lot to not like in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, but before I end things I should at least discuss the aspects I did enjoy. While I'm not a big horror movie fan, I thought that Sam Raimi did a nice job of adding some good horror visuals/moments into the film. In particular there is a scene where the heroes are chased through a tunnel and I liked the vibe I felt as danger was pursuing them. There's not much I can criticize about the acting in the film. Most actors have to play multiple versions of the same characters and I thought they all did a good job with it. While the fan service was stupid and presented like it was the most important thing in the film, I did appreciate that it was somewhat limited. They didn't spend the entire time making callbacks to other films/series from the past, and the surprise cameos didn't last long or play a vital part in the story. I can't say Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is an atrocious film that I'll never watch again, but it is just one more sign that the MCU is on the decline. As this universe expands, I simply don't find it getting better, and I worry it may not be for me any more.","[['any interest', 'Doctor Strange', 'the whole magical/mystical thing'], [], ['a result',

100,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,Worth the ticket but mid- to low Marvel,"This movie was okay. It has a lot going for it, and I was jumping from joy at the end for a certain outcome which immediately raised my score with 1 point, but at the end of the day this was kinda disappointing.The good is the cinematography and visuals which are, mostly, great. I actually saw the movie in 3D and that was trippy and worth it! I highly recommend seeing this movie in 3D. Everyone did a great acting job, except for Elizabeth Olsen of course - probably the worst casting choice in Marvel history. The very high, and weird, pace of the movie trickles out into a few pretty cool and good and horror-esque moments in the 3rd act with a couple of moments that are pretty gorey for a Disney superhero movie. We also get a few cool pretty nice fights, but sadly here the praise ends.Where this movie fails is in the story. It is very, very, very thin. Perhaps some of the plot holes I saw actually wasn't plot holes, everything move so fast, but there are definitely a bunch of them.They take the already thin story from Spiderman: No way home, and the nonsense story from Wandavision and mix it together in a psychedelic weirdness soup which never really amounts to anything. This mindtrip and very high pace of the movie is meant to cover this up, to make you not notice how badly told and how badly written this movie actually is.Xochitl Gomez who does a great acting job, she is wonderful actually, but her character America Chavez is just thrown in there and with very little background story she becomes the McGuffin of the story. America is a very liberal very PC and very ""diverse"" character in the comics, so although I see people complain I did not mind that at all. She stays true to who she is in the comics, and I have no problem with that, it is the character here in this movie and how badly written she is that bothers me.The jokes never land. I think I chuckled a bit once, the other attempts at ""marvel humor"" did not work, especially not in this type of movie.I give the movie a couple of extra points for a marvellous post credit scene, and a few decently surprising cameo's. But in the end this is not that great of a movie, and we are also left with a few lingering questions. I think this is mid- to low Marvel. I give it a 5/10 but I will throw in 1 extra point for never having to see a certain character ever again, so 6/10.If you follow Marvel and you like superhero movies, this is of course worth it. I was not unhappy, and I think my money was well spent, but this is not anything special. The first Dr Strange was a lot better.---
review updateI just saw the movie again and I have to say it is even worse than I first thought. On second viewing the plot holes shine more, and you can clearly see that many more of the actors cannot do their jobs. The high speed of the movie, pacing completely off, make you not notice all the errors the first time around but seeing it again with this level of acting... oh my... a real travesty. And the illuminati scene with the poor casting choices and their horrible ""jokes"" was so cringe I could barely watch.On my second viewing Elizabeth Olsen also get even worse...

106,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,Superb visuals can't compensate for a slender story,"I'll start with a note about the certificate. This is a 12A in the UK. There are a lot of extended horror-inspired scenes (with director Sam Raimi clearly going back to his roots). My 13yo and 15yo were both surprised by how intense this is at times. Younger children may well find it downright scary.Now onto the film. Visually and sonically it is spectacular. A creative tour de force that the technical teams should be very proud of.But that's it's problem. It's just a technical success. The story (and most importantly the characterisations) are really thin.Now I'll confess that I always have a problem with superhero films that fall into the ""most powerful being in the universe"" trope. As soon as someone is that powerful, all tension disappears. They can just destroy everything if they want to, after all, so why are they messing around with endless force-field battles with one another?You just end up with two hours of all-powerful beings jumping from universe to universe and engaging in increasingly boring conversations about the multiverse and the power of witchcraft. With the action/horror sequences getting increasingly silly as time goes on.It does sort-of tie in with Wandavision and it does have a sequence in the middle that is clearly aimed at Marvel superfans, so if you are fully signed up to the franchise you'll get more from it than I did.But as a casual filmgoer it is disappointing.

110,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,Not Sure If I Like Where The MCU is Going,"First off: I feel that this movie was overhyped. Each new film that comes out from Marvel is promoted like it's going to be the most mind-blowing thing ever; not every Marvel movie has to be bigger than the last and that's ok!This movie is most definitely R rated. There is a lot of gore and jump scares around every corner, characters are killed in very disturbing ways, dead bodies are shown in detail, and there are many grotesque wailing spirits that possess a couple of characters. It is incredibly dark for children. There are also a lot of spiritually dark symbols too, such as serpents, a bull-like man, third eyes, demons, and maybe more things I didn't pick up on. Your kids would most definitely want to stay in your bed for a couple nights after this one. I'm an adult and I had some trouble getting through it.There were some things I liked though, like seeing Wanda again and watching her become totally unhinged. What she did was disturbing but she carried the film.However the MCU is changing and I don't know if I like where it's going. It's getting darker and harder to follow. The limitlessness of the multiverse is too much in my opinion. Where do you draw the line on anything? Where do you stop? I liked the more straightforward storylines for the characters, and I miss the older Marvel movies' simplicity. Sometimes less is more, and I hope Marvel calms down a bit with the darkness and craziness for the people who don't mind the simpler superhero movies to get comfortably lost in.","[['this movie'], ['Each new film', 'Marvel', 'mind-blowing thing', 'Marvel', 'movie', 'This movie', 'R'], ['a lot', 'gore', 'jump', 'every corner', 'detail', 'a couple'], [], ['a lot', 'a bull-like man'], ['bed', 'a couple'], ['an adult', 'some trouble', 'Wanda', 'become'], ['the film.However', 'MCU'], ['darker', 'harder'], ['The limitlessness', 'the multiverse', 'opinion'], ['the line', 'anything'], [], ['Marvel', 'simplicity'], ['Marvel', 'a bit', 'the darkness', 'craziness', 'the simpler', 'superhero']]","[['movie'], ['new film', 'Marvel', 'mind-blowing thing', 'Marvel movie', 'movie', 'R'], ['lot of gore', 'jump scares', 'corner', 'characters', 'disturbing ways', 'dead bodies', 'detail', 'spirits', 'couple of characters'], ['children'], ['lot', 'dark symbols', 'serpents', 'bull-like man', 'third eyes', 'demons', 'things'], ['kids', 'bed', 'couple nights'], ['adult', 'trouble', 'it.There', 'things', 'Wanda', 'become'], ['film.However', 'MCU'], ['darker and harder'], ['limitlessness', 'multiverse', 'opinion'], ['line on anything'], [], ['straightforward storylines', 'characters', 'Marvel movies', 'simplicity'], ['Marvel calms', 'bit', 'darkness and craziness', 'people', 'simpler superhero movies']]"

114,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,The real reasons some countries banned this movie,"Those countries who banned this movie are the lucky ones, possibly the real reason is that it sucks big time !So I went in with great expectations, firstly because I absolutely loved the first Dr Strange movie and secondly because I consider both Benedict Cumberbacht and Elizabeth Olsen as very fine actors.Unfortunately, the movie ended up a huge disappointment, the plot and characters were poorly developed, there was a lack of tension and lack of stakes for our heroes to over come.So many forced emotional scenes and clichés in the movie which failed to make us connect.I did not care about whether or not Dr Strange saved the day, I cared even less about American Chavez, she lacked any depth, and the actress playing her is just awful.We were also supposed to somehow connect with Wanda and feel for her, which was again a complete failure and supposedly we should have felt some emotions to her two annoying kids, I basically did not care at all about the characters or their motives.They tried playing with several emotions from audiences, American Chavez and her dilemma, Wanda and her dreams of kids, Dr Strange and his girlfriend, all felt flat and empty.The usual Marvel jokes were also lame and forced.As mentioned I was excited about at least having good performances from top actors, sadly, they all felt flat! I really don't know why, possibly because of the poor writing and worst dialogue. Also, emotional display without connection to the viewer ultimately led to failure.Special effects and action were decent but nothing mind blowing, some intense and sort of scary scenes were forced upon us in an attempt to create a special atmosphere but failed as well, perhaps for the 7 to 9 years old viewers it might work.Such a let down, to those people who live in a country which banned the movie, don't sweat about it, you're not missing anything special, in fact you're lucky as this to me is the worst Marvel Movie I've seen in a while.Who knows, this whole banning story could b a desperate marketing attempt as well.I think Disney just blew it, it feels like a kid's movie, probably ages 7 to 13 would enjoy this, but not for the mature and intelligent audience.I think I'm done with Marvel and Superhero movies, it's becoming over saturated.","[['this movie', 'the real reason', 'big time', 'Dr Strange', 'movie', 'Benedict Cumberbacht', 'Elizabeth Olsen', 'the movie', 'a huge disappointment', 'the plot', 'a lack', 'tension', 'lack', 'clichés', 'the movie', 'Dr Strange', 'the day', 'American Chavez', 'any depth', 'the actress', 'Wanda', 'a complete failure', 'motives.They', 'American Chavez', 'dilemma', 'Wanda', 'Dr Strange', 'girlfriend', 'Marvel'], ['the poor writing', 'dialogue'], ['emotional display', 'connection', 'the viewer', 'action', 'nothing', 'mind', 'blowing', 'sort', 'an attempt', 'a special atmosphere', 'a let', 'a country', 'the movie', 'anything', 'fact', 'Marvel Movie', 'a while.Who', 'this whole banning', 'story', 'a desperate marketing', 'attempt', 'well.I', 'Disney', 'a kid', 'movie', 'the mature', 'intelligent audience.I', 'Marvel', 'Superhero']]","[['countries', 'movie', 'lucky ones', 'real reason', 'big time', 'great expectations', 'Dr Strange movie', 'Benedict Cumberbacht', 'Elizabeth Olsen', 'movie', 'huge disappointment', 'plot and characters', 'lack of tension', 'lack of stakes', 'heroes', 'emotional scenes and clichés', 'movie', 'Dr Strange', 'day', 'American Chavez', 'depth', 'actress', 'Wanda', 'complete failure', 'emotions', 'annoying kids', 'characters', 'motives.They', 'emotions from audiences', 'American Chavez', 'dilemma', 'Wanda', 'dreams of kids', 'Dr Strange', 'girlfriend', 'Marvel jokes', 'good performances', 'top actors'], ['poor writing', 'dialogue'], ['display without connection', 'viewer', 'failure.Special effects and action', 'nothing mind blowing', 'sort', 'scary scenes', 'attempt', 'special atmosphere', 'years', 'old viewers', 'let', 'people', 'country', 'movie', 'anything', 'fact', 'Marvel Movie', 'while.Who', 'banning story', 'marketing attempt', 'well.I', 'Disney', 'kid', 'movie', 'mature', 'intelligent audience.I', 'Marvel', 'Superhero movies']]"

122,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,Elizabeth Olson and Raimi shine in a fun and exciting sequel,"Being a huge fan of the first Doctor Strange film, one that definitely didn't get enough attention in my opinion, and legendary director Sam Raimi- it was clear to me that Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was gonna be one hell of a ride- and thank god it was. The film is rather loose with its story, but it also provides a anti-typical narrative that does prove to be quite interesting and quite different than the usual Marvel schlock we have come to see from more recent films like Black Widow- though never being as pretentious or lengthy as Marvel Eternals. Where Multiverse of Madness works and the other fails, is its ability to take its audience fully into the insane experience at hand, never letting go for a second and devoting its all to every crazy moment it can. The acting is great, as I expected, Benedict Cumberbatch is again great as Doctor Strange- but even with him being the titular character- it's very clear that Elizabeth Olson as Wanda or ""The Scarlet Witch"" is clearly the biggest standout in the film altogether. Olson ties the film together in a way I didn't expect, and ties the film to a rather emotional and psychological core that is sure to please all fans of her character and devoted fans of the show WandaVision. In addition to Olson and Cumberbatch, the supporting cast also does great, especially newcomer Xochitl Gomez and the returning Rachel McAdams. The cameos can be a bit underwhelming, nothing too special or grand as some other projects. The visuals are often incredible, and thanks to Raimi's signature style- brilliantly dark and even gothic at times- and the special effects are often fun and vibrant- although it is quite silly to see that half done photoshopped eye on Doctor Strange a few times. The music is honestly fantastic, a brilliant score from genius Danny Elfman, both haunting and exciting in the best possible way. In the end, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness may not be as even or brilliant as the original- but it does a great job of enrapturing us in new worlds and embracing us in grand new ways with the characters we have grown to love- and some new ones as well.My Rating: 9.3/10.","[['a huge fan', 'Doctor Strange', 'film', 'enough attention', 'opinion', 'legendary director', 'Sam Raimi-', 'Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse', 'Madness', 'hell', 'thank god'], ['The film', 'story', 'Marvel', 'schlock', 'Black Widow-', 'Marvel Eternals'], ['Multiverse', 'Madness', 'ability', 'audience', 'the insane', 'experience', 'hand', 'every crazy moment'], ['The acting', 'Benedict Cumberbatch', 'Doctor Strange-', 'the titular character-', 'Elizabeth Olson', 'Wanda', 'Scarlet Witch', 'standout', 'the film'], ['Olson', 'the film', 'a way', 'the film', 'psychological core', 'character', 'the show', 'WandaVision'], ['addition', 'Olson', 'Cumberbatch', 'cast', 'Xochitl Gomez', 'Rachel McAdams'], ['The cameos', 'a bit', 'nothing'], ['Raimi', 'signature', 'dark', 'eye', 'Doctor Strange'], ['The music', 'a brilliant score', 'genius', 'Danny Elfman', 'both haunting', 'exciting', 'possible way'], ['the end', 'Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse', 'Madness', 'a great job', 'well.My', 'Rating']]","[['huge fan', 'Doctor Strange film', 'enough attention', 'opinion', 'director Sam Raimi-', 'Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse of Madness', 'hell', 'thank god'], ['film', 'story', 'Marvel schlock', 'films like Black Widow-', 'Marvel Eternals'], ['Multiverse of Madness works', 'other fails', 'ability', 'audience', 'insane experience', 'hand', 'crazy moment'], ['acting', 'Benedict Cumberbatch', 'Doctor Strange-', 'titular character-', 'Elizabeth Olson', 'Wanda', 'Scarlet Witch', 'standout', 'film'], ['Olson', 'film', 'way', 'film', 'psychological core', 'fans', 'character', 'devoted fans', 'show WandaVision'], ['addition', 'Olson and Cumberbatch', 'cast', 'Xochitl Gomez', 'Rachel McAdams'], ['cameos', 'bit', 'nothing', 'other projects'], ['visuals', 'thanks', 'Raimi', 'signature', 'dark', 'special effects', 'eye on Doctor Strange', 'few times'], ['music', 'score from genius Danny Elfman', 'haunting and exciting', 'possible way'], ['end', 'Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse of Madness', 'great job', 'new worlds', 'grand new ways', 'characters', 'ones as well.My Rating']]"
123,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,A STEP AWAY FROM A HORROR FILM,"Doctor Strange is happy or at least he believes he is. He may not have gotten the woman of his dreams, he may not have settled down and have had someone to care about, but he has the powers some can only dream of... all this come into question when he crosses paths with a rebellious teenager who can move between parallel universes. Recruiting Wanda Maximoff, The Scarlet Witch, to figure out who is after the girl and why, Steven Strange faces off with the enemy like no other, travels to places like no other as the line between a friend and a foe starts to blur.MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS is a movie only Sam Raimi could make and get away with. The film is just a step away from being a full flashed horror film. All throughout the stakes are very highly, at least on characters' personal level, and tongue in cheek black humour reminds me of another Raimi's favourite - DRAG ME TO HELL.Moving at a frantic speed the plot doesn't take much time to unravel. There's a twist early on and your enjoyment of the rest will depend on whether you liked it or not. But as the plot thickens you will definitely admire the approach Raimi had taken. This is a unique Marvel movie in every way imaginable.The visuals look gorgeous on giant IMAX screen and 3D is being taken advantage off at every turn (the girl that sat beside me couldn't help but duck from some objects flying straight at the audience). I had a feeling I held my breath throughout and exhaled only as credits rolled. With the running time of more than 2 hrs this really passed in a flash.I would be curious to find out fans' reactions on some of the characters' treatment, but this is definitely a direction no one but Raimi would ever dare to take.","[['Doctor Strange'], ['the woman', 'dreams', 'someone', 'question', 'a rebellious teenager'], ['Wanda Maximoff', 'Scarlet Witch', 'the girl', 'Steven Strange', 'the enemy', 'the line', 'a friend', 'a foe', 'OF MADNESS', 'a movie', 'Sam Raimi'], ['The film', 'a step', 'horror', 'film'], ['personal level', 'tongue', 'cheek black humour', 'Raimi', 'ME TO HELL.Moving', 'a frantic speed', 'the plot', 'much time'], ['enjoyment', 'the rest'], ['the plot', 'the approach', 'Raimi'], ['Marvel', 'movie', 'every way', 'IMAX', 'screen', 'advantage', 'every turn', 'the girl', 'the audience'], ['a feeling', 'breath'], ['the running time', 'hrs', 'a flash.I', 'treatment', 'a direction', 'no one', 'Raimi']]","[['Doctor Strange'], ['woman', 'dreams', 'someone', 'powers', 'question', 'paths', 'rebellious teenager', 'parallel universes'], ['Wanda Maximoff', 'Scarlet Witch', 'girl', 'Steven Strange', 'enemy', 'travels', 'places', 'line', 'friend', 'foe', 'OF MADNESS', 'movie', 'Sam Raimi'], ['film', 'step', 'horror film'], ['stakes', 'characters', 'personal level', 'tongue', 'cheek black humour', 'Raimi', 'ME TO HELL.Moving', 'frantic speed', 'plot', 'much time'], ['enjoyment', 'rest'], ['plot', 'approach Raimi'], ['Marvel movie', 'way', 'imaginable.The visuals', 'IMAX screen', 'advantage', 'turn', 'girl', 'objects', 'audience'], ['feeling', 'breath', 'credits'], ['running time', 'hrs', 'flash.I', 'fans', 'reactions', 'characters', 'treatment', 'direction', 'one but Raimi']]"

127,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,Really?,"I cannot say this is a bad movie, but it fails to be a great one.1- After ""Infinity War"" Wanda got depressed, looking for revenge during ""Endgame"" and then, getting mad on ""Wanda Vision"" but at the end she seemed to understand she could be a real danger to people and she doesn't want that. But, suddenly in ""Doctor Strange in the multiverse of Madness"" she becomes a serial killer destroying everyone she can, how many people did she kill? MANY, but it doesn't matter because in the end, she finds her sanity just like that, in a beat.

129,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,A Blast from Start to Finish,"I very much enjoyed the first Doctor Strange film and thought his character has made a nice progression thus far in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With the events of Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers: Endgame, WandaVision, and Spider-Man: No Way Home, I was slightly concerned about this film being able to stand on its own. Now here's the thing, it doesn't, but I still thought it was great. In fact, I think it's an even more entertaining film than the first Doctor Strange. I would even go as far as saying it would be in my conversation of the better Marvel Cinematic Universe films. Here's why, as long as you're caught up on the connected properties, this one is more than worth your time.Picking up after the events of Spider-Man: No Way Home and WandaVision, both of which laid the groundwork for how the multiverse is talked about in this film, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness takes no time at all before it dives right into the action/madness. If for nothing else, I loved the pace. The film spends just enough time in the first few minutes to establish where relations are with other characters from the first Doctor Strange, but very quickly sets up how and why the multiverse is the mainline throughout the film. Without giving anything away, the reason the multiverse becomes the main plot is due to the character of Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen). Her presence here was electric and I couldn't get enough of it, but I can't go into any details without ruining her story here.With the introduction of a new character in America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) very early on in the film, it becomes clear that she will be a staple in future films for sure. I'm okay with that because her performance here, along with her arc throughout the film, was all engaging to me. Her abilities and how she has them needs to be explored a little further in the future, but she was a very interesting character. Her interactions with Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) throughout the film were great as well. They share some great chemistry together. With all of that said, let's dive into a couple of minor issues I think some fans may have.There has been a lot of hype surrounding big cameos and appearances from familiar faces, and while there is definitely a small chunk of the film dedicated to just that, I can see why people are saying this film was overhyped. Personally, I didn't know too much going into it, so I was very surprised by a couple of appearances. Still, where I feel people will be disappointed is in the fact that the multiverse itself remains focused solely on Wanda and Strange throughout the entire film. A lot more could've been explored, but I found that holding back made for a better overall film. There are some fun cameos for sure, but I think they went as far as they needed to. This film benefitted from not being bogged down by needless multiverse stuff. Plus, I believe this is still just the beginning of what kind of wacky adventures are coming in the next few films.Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness didn't blow my mind in ways I was thinking it would, but it was also much more of a focussed story and used the fun cameos for a purpose in a way I wasn't expecting either. This film was great in my opinion. Yes, you do need to see a few other Marvel Cinematic Universe entries to fully enjoy everything on display here, but it's worth it. I just had a blast with it from start to finish. Sam Raimi, who directed this film, has his vision on full display here and being a fan of his work for many years, that put a smile on my face. There are a few thrilling scenes that border on a bit of horror and that was also nice to see. Although other films/series have delved into the multiverse already, this film felt like a breath of fresh air for the franchise. It's not perfect and I have some nitpicks with certain things, but I loved watching it.","[['Doctor Strange', 'film', 'character', 'a nice progression', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe'], ['Infinity War', 'Endgame', 'WandaVision', 'Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'this film'], ['the thing'], ['fact', 'entertaining film', 'Doctor Strange'], ['conversation', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe'], ['Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'WandaVision', 'the groundwork', 'the multiverse', 'this film', 'Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse', 'Madness', 'no time', 'the action/madness'], ['nothing', 'the pace'], ['The film', 'enough time', 'Doctor Strange', 'the multiverse', 'the mainline', 'the film'], ['anything', 'the reason', 'the multiverse', 'the main plot', 'the character', 'Wanda Maximoff', 'Elizabeth Olsen'], ['presence', 'story', 'here.With', 'the introduction', 'a new character', 'America Chavez', 'Xochitl Gomez', 'the film', 'a staple'], ['performance', 'arc', 'the film'], ['the future', 'interesting character'], ['Stephen Strange', 'Benedict Cumberbatch', 'the film'], ['share', 'some great chemistry'], ['a couple', 'a lot', 'hype', 'a small chunk', 'the film', 'this film'], ['a couple'], ['the fact', 'the multiverse', 'Wanda', 'Strange', 'the entire film'], ['A lot', 'overall film'], ['some fun', 'cameos'], ['This film', 'needless multiverse', 'stuff'], ['the beginning', 'kind', 'the next few films.Doctor', 'Strange', 'Multiverse', 'Madness', 'mind', 'a focussed story', 'the fun', 'cameos', 'a purpose', 'a way'], ['This film', 'opinion'], ['Marvel Cinematic Universe', 'everything', 'display'], ['a blast', 'start'], ['Sam Raimi', 'this film', 'vision', 'full display', 'a fan', 'work', 'a smile', 'face'], ['a few thrilling', 'a bit', 'horror'], ['the multiverse', 'this film', 'a breath', 'fresh air', 'the franchise'], []]","[['Doctor Strange film', 'character', 'nice progression', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe'], ['events of Avengers', 'Infinity War', 'Avengers', 'Endgame', 'WandaVision', 'Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'film'], ['thing'], ['fact', 'entertaining film', 'Doctor Strange'], ['conversation', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe films'], ['connected properties', 'events of Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'WandaVision', 'groundwork', 'multiverse', 'film', 'Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse of Madness', 'time', 'action/madness'], ['nothing', 'pace'], ['film', 'enough time', 'first few minutes', 'relations', 'other characters', 'Doctor Strange', 'multiverse', 'mainline', 'film'], ['anything', 'reason', 'multiverse', 'main plot', 'character of Wanda Maximoff', 'Elizabeth Olsen'], ['presence', 'details', 'story here.With', 'introduction', 'character in America Chavez', 'Xochitl Gomez', 'film', 'staple', 'future films'], ['performance', 'arc', 'film'], ['abilities', 'future', 'interesting character'], ['interactions with Stephen Strange', 'Benedict Cumberbatch', 'film'], ['share', 'great chemistry'], ['couple', 'minor issues', 'fans', 'lot of hype', 'big cameos and appearances', 'small chunk', 'film', 'people', 'film'], ['couple of appearances'], ['people', 'fact', 'multiverse', 'Wanda and Strange', 'entire film'], ['lot', 'overall film'], ['fun cameos'], ['film', 'multiverse stuff'], ['beginning', 'kind', 'wacky adventures', 'films.Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse of Madness', 'mind in ways', 'focussed story', 'fun cameos', 'purpose', 'way'], ['film', 'opinion'], ['Marvel Cinematic Universe entries', 'everything on display'], ['blast', 'start'], ['Sam Raimi', 'film', 'vision', 'full display', 'fan', 'work', 'many years', 'smile', 'face'], ['thrilling scenes', 'bit of horror'], ['other films/series', 'multiverse', 'film', 'breath', 'fresh air', 'franchise'], ['nitpicks', 'certain things']]"

137,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,Too many multiverse movies,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was not a continuation from Spider Man: No Way Home instead it concentrated on a whole new realm. Sam Raimi returns from hiatus to director this mess of storyline. The story finds Dr Strange played by Benedict Cumberbatch trying to help a girl name America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) who falls in the lap of Dr Strange on Earth 632. It seems a future Earth group of superhero's is keeping track of all the multiverses that Dr Stange has had an effect. Strange and Wong work together to protect America from the Scarlett Witch played by Elizabeth Olsen. I didn't understand how Dr Strange did not know Wanda had turned evil. I mean Strange knew which instance the Avengers would be able to defeat Thanos but yet he couldn't foresee this situation, come on. The whole movie dragged and it was not crisp, the editing was off and the special effects were very cartoonish. Few reasons I gave a little higher score was from the cameos by Chiwetel Ejifor as Baron Mordo, Hayley Atwell as Captain Carter, John Krazinski as Stretch, and Patrick Stewart reprising his role as Professor X. From all the marvel movies ever made I got to say this was the worst.

141,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,Some of the worst writing I've ever seen.,"The graphics, directing, acting, etc were all fine. It only cost untold millions of dollars to make, after all. The story. My goodness, the very bad story. Not a horror film. Not scary. Not funny. Not fun. Not intelligent or interesting. Just very bad.SPOILERS;The villain has a plan. Commit mass murder, kill the mother of some children and kidnap those children to raise as her own. Only until they turn 14 and swear at her for saying they can't go out with their friends on a Friday and she continues to kill the kids and mass murder starts over. Just a murderous psychopath.The scarlet witch, Wanda Maximof has ""hex"" powers, defined as loosely as you want with potential to alter reality. In this, she can do anything the plot requires, can do as much damage to anyone as plot requires, and cannot be physically injured despite being a squishy average human female.Her mind is more powerful than that of professor X of the X men. Well, it's not and he could kill her with a thought, but plot demands he lose, so he does instantly. Reed Richards is pretty much Adolf Hitler with an IQ of 500, but knowing everything about scarlet witch, he has no plans and dies instantly. Captain marvel, who goes toe to toe with people like Thanos is killed by a 3 meter tall statue falling over. None of this could or would ever happen unless a bad story required the villain win instantly with no effort.Did I mention that she can do absolutely anything the plot calls for? This story is about Wanda doing absolutely anything required to win in a scene and everybody else trying to stop it, despite automatically failing repeatedly.The movie ends when she finds out that she is an evil genocidal psychopath and her plan is as stupid as we all knew it was the minute you found out what the plan was.","[[], [], ['The story'], ['goodness', 'bad story'], ['a horror', 'film'], [], [], ['fun'], [], ['The villain', 'a plan'], ['Commit', 'mass', 'murder', 'the mother'], ['Friday', 'mass', 'murder'], ['a murderous psychopath.The', 'scarlet', 'witch', 'Wanda Maximof', 'reality'], ['anything', 'the plot', 'much damage', 'anyone', 'plot', 'a squishy average human female.Her', 'mind', 'professor', 'X', 'X'], ['a thought', 'plot'], ['Reed Richards', 'Adolf Hitler', 'IQ', 'everything', 'scarlet', 'witch'], ['Captain', 'marvel', 'Thanos', 'meter', 'tall', 'statue'], ['None', 'a bad story', 'the villain', 'no effort.Did', 'anything', 'the plot'], ['This story', 'Wanda', 'anything', 'a scene', 'everybody', 'repeatedly.The movie', 'an evil genocidal', 'psychopath', 'plan', 'the minute', 'the plan']]","[['graphics'], ['millions of dollars'], ['story'], ['goodness', 'bad story'], ['horror film'], [], [], ['fun'], [], ['villain', 'plan'], ['Commit mass murder', 'mother', 'children', 'children'], ['friends', 'Friday', 'kids', 'mass murder'], ['psychopath.The scarlet witch', 'Wanda Maximof', 'powers', 'reality'], ['anything', 'plot', 'much damage', 'anyone as plot', 'female.Her mind', 'professor X', 'X men'], ['thought', 'plot demands'], ['Reed Richards', 'Adolf Hitler', 'IQ', 'everything about scarlet witch', 'plans'], ['Captain marvel', 'people like Thanos', 'meter tall statue'], ['None', 'bad story', 'villain', 'effort.Did', 'anything', 'plot'], ['story', 'Wanda', 'anything', 'scene and everybody', 'repeatedly.The movie', 'genocidal psychopath', 'plan', 'minute', 'plan']]"

Nearly walked out twice.Beyond that, D is for Disney and Disney=diversity for diversity sake, and they checked nearly all the boxes in this one.

Another lead, a ""the chosen one"" trope, is a Hispanic teen with two moms and wearing a Pride pin, at least one of which is Asian.Being the ""multiverse"" There is all sorts of reality tinkering. Dr Strange appears in at least 3 variations of himself, one from a corpse. Scarlet Witch shed her Avenger ways to threaten the the universe so she can have children. Captain America comes back as Captain Carter, formerly known as Agent Penny Carter played by Hayley Atwell, and gets killed. X-Men Professor Xavier is resurrected for 5 minutes only to be killed again. And on it goes. Like I said, bizarre. Did I mention confusing, uninteresting?

146,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,"""Este güey no sabe español?""","1st : Highly recommend watching Wanda+Vision. Knowing what happened in Spider-Man's latest entry helps.2nd : Has a few elements that force you to consider watching early, if you don't want to step away from the internet and the inevitable spoilers! Although they don't really add much to the core story of the movie, aside from being a set-piece and a ""bump on the road"". Noticeably fabricated to make people talk and want to watch.Anyway, I'm conflicted!It's definitely worth a watch if you still care about this universe. It's well crafted, acted and shot (some interesting camera angles here and there)! They properly told the story they wanted to tell (it being great is another story).At the same time, many things left me wanting more. While it isn't as ""skippable"" as Eternals or Cap Marvel, and doesn't follow the known formula.. I'm not interested in watching it again any time soon! Maybe it's my fault for expecting more. I would have liked the NEXT step in the evolution of Dr Strange, and less of the ""same"".MAGIC & PROGRESS - What do I mean by same-y? It feels like there has been little progress in the mage's skills, as if we are continuing exactly from where we left off. Magic is used sparsely and with limited results. I would expect our Doctor Strange to feel powerful at this point! But it's like he came out of graduation and barely has any field experience. There's too many pauses, casting time, and ridiculous childish spells.. like summoning a pair of demonic hands to grab a street-pole to whack someone! This to me is the worst part. Strange felt incompetent at the start (stumbling through Magic), and then again in No Way Home.. and now in this Madness.STORY - While a bit chaotic, it's easily followed. Doesn't leave much to the imagination, and doesn't do anything new or mind-bending. If anything, it was probably made without a real plan, and for general audiences to REALLY enjoy. The few nods here and there aren't really enough for fans to go crazy over.. unless they are superficial and easily pleased. It does introduce a new character in America Chavez, but it's still very introspective on the character of Stephen. It slightly deals with a few new topics (some reminiscent of a ""What If"" episode), but the arc doesn't feel earned or advanced in the end. All in all, it feels too humane and grounded.OTHER - Music usage and forced-horror elements are WAY too crafted and noticeable at times, which takes away from the experience. At no point did I feel tense or scared. It's kind of childish, even! I also felt the movie slowed down for no reason (a certain tunnel scene).Finally, the VILLAIN. ""They"" work as a scale to compare with Strange's growth, making the lack of new skills even more noticeable. You could even say this appearance overshadows the main cast!I also didn't particularly like what they did with a specific character. While it was different and unexpected, it felt shallow and directionless. Reminds of what Rian Johnson did to Star Wars: The Last Jedi. I ask myself if they allowed the writers and Raimi to do whatever they wanted. A part of me thinks Marvel finally lost hold of reins of their horse, and it is doing whatever now.I'm sure people will like it. But I walked out thinking I would have seen this at home, no problem.

Yes.,"If you were looking for a Dr. Strange heavy movie with lots of character development, you'd be disappointed. This feels more like an extended season finale for WandaVision brought to the big screen. The focus was one big fight between Wanda & Dr. Strange, with some new minor characters brought in but with no real context or development throughout the film. As expected from the trailer & director, this is one of Marvel's darkest films. It's not super demonic, but it will give young kids a scare, & was dark enough that I would never watch this again for solo entertainment. Also plan to go in on a full stomach or with water in hand. There are so many visuals that it sometimes felt like I was watching through a kaleidoscope, way more constant than the first Dr. Strange, & I got nauseous & dizzy throughout the movie.

155,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,Should have been released on Halloween,"Marvel's streak of very good movies, starting with Black Widow in 2021, has come to a screeching halt with this multi-confusing, convoluted Dr. Strange debacle. A proven director, this disappointing Sam Raimi effort is nothing short of a horror movie with its demons, zombies and pretty frightening (at times) effects. So much so that a mom sitting near us took her 8-year oldish son from the theater about half way through, never to return. Maybe it had something to do with watching a 16 year old girl being tortured by the Scarlet Witch. Unlike the innocent Spider-Man, Iron Man and Captain America-type movies, I would not take any one under 10 (at least) to see this.For some reason, some of the writers in this series like to make the good guys into bad guys, and pit Avenger vs. Avenger. It's done here again with a suddenly delusional, occasionally evil Scarlet Witch, who has somehow developed powers she didn't have when facing Thanos a few movies earlier. She does do the right thing at end, but it's too late to save this scary, creature feature.ghoul fest. Not even the lame special guest appearances could help.

159,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,The choice is yours,"Directed by Sam Raimi Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness has us following up with Stephen Strange(Benedict Cumberbatch). Stephen finds himself on a multiversal journey. When he comes across a young girl named America Chavez(Xochitl Gomez) being pursued by a monster. When he and Wong question her they find out that She has the power to freely travel the Multiverse. And soon other beings begin seeking America. Madness would be the best way to describe this film for both better and worst. The movie within its limits does not hold back from its visuals, action, and Gore It throws a lot at you. The Locations are interesting although there are some realities that when you see them it feels as though you wish you got to see slightly more of those locations. The story does fall apart in many areas there are plot holes where it is clear that doing the multiverse has opened up some recons. In many ways, it feels cluttered in some parts. The tone in many ways feels like a Raimi film when it's said that this is not like the rest of the MCU it's not that far off. There are some things that kids might be able to handle. While you do get the typical Jokes it is not as Forumulalic. Yes, there's a villain and yes the overall goal is to stop the villain. The Action is intense, fast, and Bloody Old PG-13 Style Bloody. The amount of Death that Follows in this Film and How Brutal some of it is Executed. Combine with horror Elements, when it is Raimi putting his vision to the screen. It's here where the film is at its best, when the movie starts to pull away that's where it loses some of its appeal. It might not feel in line with the rest of the MCU you, but it does feel more in line with Doctor Strange. Where sometimes it is bright and colorful, but also has its more grim occult Morbid. The cast themselves Benedict Cumberbatch of course is just as great as always He embodies this character While still having much of that Charm. Although he is downplayed a bit. The whole time people are just judging him saying he's an idiot and he is at fault at the time. And moments where he is just gullible. Wong is Good though he has his problems. Elizabeth Olsen quite possibly has the best performance in the film. Let's just say that they don't puss out with her. The whole plot with American Chavez would seem like if you were going to introduce this character this would probably be the best to put her. While She is not in the way and thrown in the background. Why? Really out of all the characters could introduce you to go with this one. You didn't really need her Stephen and Wanda would have been enough. And Mordo is just there. The Cameos some are cool and others are meh. Overall Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness While does excel again with its style and visuals, the music by Danny Elfman is great.

174,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,Not sure how the Wanda weirdos will take this but I had fun,"In my review of Black Widow, I talked about how Marvel fans aren't generally that good at dealing with death.I wrote that death is so rare and/or weightless in the Marvel Universe that the moment someone finally becomes expendable enough to get killed off, fangirls despair. I wrote that the actually meaningful deaths, e.g. That of Black Widow, thus need to be fixed by having the characters appear in prequels, lest the fangirls start a petition to resurrect them (as they did with Quicksilver) because God forbid anything in this canon actually poses a genuine threat to anyone.Something I failed to mention was the impending Multiverse saga. Now, the possibilities are endless. Anyone we've had to bid farewell to can now very easily be brought back, long as we search within the right timeline, ""parallel universe"", or whatever.And in no Marvel Studios property were loss and grief so crucial as in last year's WandaVision, where Wanda ""Scarlet Witch"" Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) dabbled in the interdimensional to possibly bring back the person -- or android -- she loves. In the well-made but oft-sloppy Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, she may just get her chance! The movies, after all, are still the ""main"" content.As much as I enjoyed WandaVision, it does largely exist as a set-up for this new biggie, where the titular Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) begins to explore the Multiverse -- after last year's Spider-Man shenanigans -- and the redoubtable Wanda uses her increasingly evolved witchcraft to ""help"" (or so it seems at first). You'll recall that WandaVision hinted at a connection to a certain other Marvel-branded universe (not just an alternate MCU timeline) and that this particular plot point was just a gag. But after No Way Home introduced that concept for realsies, that's what we're doin'.I doubt that's a spoiler to anyone after the Super Bowl ad blew up on Twitter back in February and we learned that Patrick Stewart will reprise his role as Charles Xavier (?) from the X-Men film series -- which has such lousy continuity it may as well take place in its own Multiverse. We also see Baron Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) again, as well as Shuma-Gorath, which, as a fan of Marvel vs. Capcom, is one of those character choices that actually got the geek within me kinda stoked. Xochitl Gomez plays newcomer America Chavez, whose superhero shtick is the fact that she's the only America Chavez across the Multiverse; her power is to journey between them.The movie isn't terrible. The visuals, as guaranteed by the very premise, are much more creative and striking than most MCU films (though some shots recall Thanos' usage of the Reality Gem in Avengers: Infinity War), but it's still about as safe and inoffensive as this kind of story will permit. Its best parts are the ones where Sam Raimi is allowed to go full ""Army of Darkness"" on our asses, taking a break from the Marvel Sludge™. I may even have gotten some feels during its climax.While it works fine on its own -- despite some glaring continuity issues -- and, on the flip side, its connections to other MCU plots are expected, I am left wondering what the latest mainline Marvel works TRULY have to do with each other.As of now, the Phase Four storylines don't acknowledge each other all that much -- even when it comes to, say, revelations on how the very cosmos functions (one second Kang is effectively God, the next it's the Celestials). Worse yet, they don't indicate any sort of common goal. Phase Two had similar problems, but even then, the endgame was clear. Here, some works head one way; some head another. Some works, even if they feel like skippable teases, add stuff of great importance, but this stuff only matters to this or that series.I'm starting to wonder if Kevin Feige still has a plan. Back in the day, even if the world-building was occasionally questionable, the MCU mostly held together and was clearly building toward the Infinity Saga. Even when the post-credit teasers were for solo adventures like Black Panther and Spider-Man: Homecoming, almost all movies seemed to look toward the same ultimate battle. Now, all kinds of universe-breaking things are being built up/teased, all of them going in different directions.Shang-Chi teased something huge with the Ten Rings that hasn't been elaborated upon (despite Benedict Wong, who made the urgent discovery, having appeared in two flicks since). Eternals introduced all kinds of crazy sh-t, but only really teased the Blade reboot without any sign we'll see the Eternals, say, have dinner with the Avengers (or that anyone gives a f-ck about the giant Celestial that almost burst through the planet à la Bionicle 4). All the Black Widow-Hawkeye stuff is kind of going its own way too. And while Loki indicated that the next MCU ""boss"" will be Kang the Conqueror, I now honestly doubt we'll see that many Avengers come together to fight him. He's in an Ant-Man movie next, for crying out loud!All that being said, I think Doctor Strange 2 works just fine as its own movie (taking better advantage of these concepts than the first Strange) and that it hints at interesting things to come. But really, the most rewarding part has been people's reactions to Wanda's lamentation (as seen in the Super Bowl ad) that she gets labeled a villain just because she broke the rules once:Some of us would point out that what she did to ""break the rules"", more precisely, was to mind-control an entire village into acting out her small-town fantasies. Others would reveal more than enough about themselves by either playing Wanda's Advocate (though their defenses would usually reduce themselves to ""Well, yes, BUT..."") or explicitly declare that Wanda could commit genocide and they would still ""stan"" this fictional comic-book lady -- which is a very normal and well-adjusted thing to base your personality/Twitter persona around. Take this with you the next time you worry Zoomers use the Internet too much; it's literally better for public safety that some people are terminally online.","[['review', 'Black Widow', 'death',

175,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,Phase 4 isn't really doing it for me,"Holy mother of god I'm so divided. I feel like this rating will change, but there are so many things about this mess that are great, and so many that didn't really leave much of a mark.One thing that's been really prevalent in the MCU following the release of Endgame is this weird clunkiness that seems to find its way into every new release from Marvel. The effects, characters, script, method of storytelling... it's all felt rather stale and incomplete. I think Shang-Chi or Far From Home were the closest to achieving the divide between real and fake and making the fake feel reasonably real. There's something about phase 4 that's just really odd. The overindulgence of effects and cgi is really throwing me off. And it does this very prominently in Doctor Strange 2.The script felt incredibly unnatural in the first act, and I think some of what we saw from Doctor Strange in NWH rubbed off here too. Dr. Strange just doesn't feel like the same character here. He's not nearly as stubborn or hard-headed as the surgeon sorcerer we knew in Infinity War, Endgame, or even in the original Doctor Strange. I just can't grasp why, I just have this feeling.Wanda's kids.... I can't. They suck. They're terrible. They feel really goofy. Any time I should feel sorry for Wanda I can't because of that.Now onto the better things.When the effects were great, lemme tell you, they were great. Raimi really has his *ish locked and loaded. The horror aspects of the film really scared the living *ish out of me. Wanda is insanely threatening, and her motives were clear, tragic, and dimensional. She was awesome. The entire interaction between her and the Illuminati felt really similar to Amazon Prime's Invincible... you know what scene I'm talking about. I really liked the inclusion of more superheroes as well as those we've seen before taken on by the face of another.One thing I can say about this film too, is that it diverges and separates itself from what we're used to. It felt at some points I was watching a completely different film, and it was truly an experience. Very reminiscent of Eternals in that it truly shines above all else and makes the story its own, far far away from the Marvel formula. I hope Raimi gets another chance to direct, because I'm here for it when he gets full creative control.Also... no body no death^if they killed off Wanda I give up, I'm gonna convince myself that this message truly means something.","[['Holy', 'mother', 'god'], ['this rating', 'this mess', 'a mark.One thing', 'MCU', 'the release', 'Endgame', 'this weird clunkiness', 'way', 'every new release', 'Marvel'], ['script', 'method'], ['Home', 'the divide', 'the fake feel'], ['something', 'phase'], ['The overindulgence', 'cgi'], ['Doctor Strange', 'script', 'the first act', 'Doctor Strange', 'NWH'], ['Dr'], ['the same character'], ['the surgeon', 'sorcerer', 'Infinity War', 'Endgame', 'Doctor Strange'], ['this feeling.Wanda'], [], [], [], [], ['Any time', 'sorry', 'Wanda', 'that.Now', 'things.When'], ['Raimi'], ['The horror', 'the film', 'the living', '*'], ['Wanda'], [], ['The entire interaction', 'Illuminati', 'Amazon Prime', 'scene'], ['the inclusion', 'the face', 'another.One thing', 'this film'], ['different film', 'an experience'], ['reminiscent', 'the story', 'Marvel', 'formula'], ['Raimi', 'another chance', 'full creative', 'control.Also', 'no body', 'no death^if', 'Wanda', 'this message', 'something']]","[['Holy mother', 'god'], ['rating', 'many things', 'mess', 'mark.One thing', 'MCU', 'release of Endgame', 'weird clunkiness', 'way', 'release from Marvel'], ['effects', 'characters', 'script', 'method'], ['Home', 'divide', 'fake feel'], ['something about phase'], ['overindulgence of effects', 'cgi'], ['Doctor Strange', 'script', 'first act', 'Doctor Strange', 'NWH'], ['Dr'], ['same character'], ['surgeon sorcerer', 'Infinity War', 'Endgame', 'Doctor Strange'], ['feeling.Wanda', 'kids'], [], [], [], [], ['time', 'sorry for Wanda', 'that.Now', 'things.When', 'effects'], ['Raimi'], ['horror aspects', 'film', 'living *'], ['Wanda', 'motives'], [], ['entire interaction', 'Illuminati', 'Amazon Prime', 'scene'], ['inclusion', 'superheroes', 'face', 'another.One thing', 'film'], ['points', 'different film', 'experience'], ['reminiscent of Eternals', 'shines', 'story', 'Marvel formula'], ['Raimi', 'chance', 'creative control.Also', 'body', 'death^if', 'Wanda', 'message', 'something']]"

187,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,Continues the titular hero's story with stunning visuals and solid emotional payoffs,"""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" is the sequel to 2016's ""Doctor Strange"" and the 28th film to be set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead role and directed by Sam Raimi (The ""Evil Dead"" trilogy, Sony Pictures's ""Spider-Man"" trilogy, ""Drag Me To Hell""), it continues the titular hero's story with stunning visuals and solid emotional payoffs.A short time after the events of ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"", Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) saves New York City from an invisible octopus creature while rescuing a mysterious young girl amidst the chaos. The girl later introduces herself as America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez), revealing to him that she has the ability to travel across the multiverse, which in turn has attracted many dangerous creatures after her powers. After hearing her explanation, Strange learns that his alternate self from America's universe was under mind control via witchcraft and decides to meet up with Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) to see if she knows anything about these current events.Since his big screen debut back in 2016, Doctor Strange has established himself as one of the most important heroes in the entire MCU. From making a giant inter-dimensional entity rage quit his evil plans to holding his own against the mad Titan Thanos in a battle for the Infinity Stones, Strange is not only a valuable asset to the Avengers, but also an incredibly powerful hero in his own right. Six years after his first film, Strange finally has another solo role outside of appearing in other hero's films with ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" showing us the dire consequences of tampering with unknown forces.In contrast to previous films and TV series showing the fun aspects of accessing the multiverse, this one treats the very idea of its unfamiliarity as a deadly serious issue. Strange, who experienced first hand what happens when things go horribly wrong back in ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"", is presented in an incredibly vulnerable state. Gone is the cocky sorcerer supreme he started out as and what we have in his place is someone who hasn't yet realised the severity of toying with something so frightening. This adds some much needed depth to Strange as a character, similar to how it took the loss of half the universe's population for Tony Stark to realise importance of having a true family. Stark and Strange have always been kindred spirits with arrogant personalities who need a reality check in order to humble themselves, and this film shows how the latter is now coming to terms with this sudden urge to keep his ego in check.Returning to the director's chair after nine years, Sam Raimi injects his signature style into every scene while also delivering a Marvel film like no other so far. Of course, Raimi is no stranger to the superhero genre since many are familiar with his work on the Sony ""Spider-Man"" films but he is also known for writing and directing horror films like the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy and ""Drag Me to Hell"". It seems like some of Raimi's personal affinity for the genre has rubbed off into this one since he can't help but push the boundaries of what the audience could consider nightmare fuel. I loved how he made the hostile inhabitants of various multiverses seem so terrifying, even relying on the odd jump scare to keep viewers on their toes. Another thing Raimi is known for is his off-the-wall comic relief intended to calm the audiences' nerves after viewing something scary. There were plenty of moments that should provide the occasional chuckle to relieve the tension in a scene, some of which may even surprise veteran MCU fans. I can't discuss too much else about Raimi's best directorial moments since they will venture into major spoiler territory so all I will say is that if you are familiar with his films, keep a close eye out for some of those hidden Easter eggs.Visually, this is the most vibrant looking Marvel film to date. Raimi goes all out to emphasise how much better or worse these multiverses look in comparison to our own. Certain places may give off the appearance of somewhere futuristic and high tech while others look like a post-apocalyptic wasteland. No matter which of the two, I really enjoyed how different they each seemed whenever Strange happened to stumble into one or the other. Despite all of these intertwining universes, the film is still pretty easy to follow. In most other media that deal with inter-dimensional travel and exploration, you expect things to be confusing due to the multitude of things happening all at once. However, for the most part, the film has adopted a more straightforward method of telling the story. I'm not sure if this was Raimi's decision or if Kevin Feige and the other higher ups at Disney wanted things this way, but I think this was the right thing to do overall.Something else that took me by surprise was the quality of the film's score. In recent decades, there haven't been that many memorable musical motifs in superhero films. Aside from perhaps some of the Batman movies, the MCU happens to be the worst offender in this category. ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" appears to remedy this by recruiting Danny Elfman to bring us what could be considered the best musical score in a Marvel film since the four ""Avengers"" movies. Not only does Elfman implement some of the original ""Doctor Strange"" theme into his score but also certain tunes from other media I won't mention here at the risk of giving away spoilers. Elfman is a frequent collaborator with Sam Raimi so their combined efforts helped elevate this film above what could have been another one with a forgettable score. In addition to keeping an eye out for visual Easter eggs, I also think fans should keep an ear out as well.As mentioned earlier, the Doctor Strange we have been familiar with over the past six years is noticeably different in this film and Benedict Cumberbatch plays into that perfectly. I liked seeing this more pragmatic Strange making decisions based on what is necessary rather than out of recklessness, especially after we are shown the dangerous ramifications of upsetting the balance of the multiverse. Likewise, it's also nice to see Elizabeth Olsen finally having the opportunity to play Wanda Maximoff closer to her Scarlet Witch persona. I'd been wondering when we'd actually see this particular incarnation on the big screen and it sure was satisfying to see her done justice. Also, newcomer Xochitl Gomez does a fine job holding her own alongside the rest of the cast. It's always entertaining to see young characters who wield incredible powers finding out how to keep them under control and it's equally as interesting to see how she learns how to use them in combat.I feel I should now address the elephant in the room, in that there has been speculation over the implementation of some newly acquired IPs thanks to Disney's buyout of certain companies. Before its release, there were many rumours circulating that this film contains some exciting alleged cameos. Without spoiling any of these possible appearances, all I will say is keep your expectations to a reasonable level because not all of them turned out to be true. This film is by no means on the same plain as ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" in terms of fanservice but it does have a few great surprises that seem to show the direction the MCU is heading.In its current state, the MCU looks set to deliver some new and exciting content in the near future. From what I can gather, Phase 4 has undoubtedly been its most experimental so far. We've seen Disney+ series expand upon some already established hero backstories and some movies that have even deviated from the typical origin story template as a whole. ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" is yet another crucial puzzle piece in a bigger picture that has long been laid out for us. Regardless of how it all turns out in the end, the MCU isn't going anywhere anytime soon.I rate it 8/10.","[['Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse', 'Madness', 'the sequel', 'Doctor Strange', 'film', 'Marvel

192,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,Book of Madness,"Sam Raimi is back - usually it is not a nice thing to say. Where was he? Was he away? What did he do and so forth ... all things that one has to answer. Maybe he was in a differeren universe (one of the other Multiverses you know?) or somewhere else. But it is just a simple welcome back to the big screens. And I am certain he will be succesful with this outing. Actually the money generated already makes this one of the biggest hits (potentially) of this year.But enough of financial and personal gain (of the director). This is a continuation of the Dr. Strange story - but also a continuation of the story of Wanda Maximoff. The nowadays better know Olson sister of them all. If you have seen Wandavision - which does not seem to be too necessary. It is a nice to know - like there may be also something that might give you some What if callback (Season 1 that is, the only one available right now). On the other hand Sam Raimi also has his usual recurring actor - in a neat small and funny role.So combine the stories (and no Spiderman, though Avengers in general get name checked) and add the Sam Raimi flavor to it. Because there is horror - so much so, that it seems like some viewers felt the need to express this here on imdb by claiming that the violence level is high. Well for a Marvel (MCU) superhero movie you can say that. Do not expect this to be super brutal though.Not much about the story was shared and I avoided most spoilers. Thankfully I did not watch the trailers - there are quite a few moments that are taken away from the first time on the big screen experience. Which was on an Imax screen for me - and in 3D. The effects were quite nice - though having the Avatar 2 trailer playing right before it ... well let's just say that looks monumental. Hopefully that will not take anything away from what some will experience.Back to this for one last time: action starts off from the start, you won't have much time to think about what is happening (which is a good thing, because there are quite a few holes to be found here), there is not enough time to explore all the Multiverses and even with 2 plus hour run time, this does not feel like it is too long - rather the opposite.As usual stay for the scenes during and after the credits. One mid and one after. Both are well worth the wait - revelation wise and the other one because it is just super funny. New characters get introduced here and the Dr. Strange universe gets expanded. I wouldn't mind seeing more of Wong ... very funny and playfully acted by .. Wong.

The movie definitely could've been longer but I think the individual conflicts of the characters were pretty good, although America Chavez should've gotten her Disney+ show released before this movie because she felt a little out of place and sudden in the movie. The action had great balance with grounded fights, monster fights, extremely weird and funny fights, and lots of sorcery and witchcraft. The cameos in this movie didn't feel as well earned as No Way Home's Spider-men but some of them were pretty funny and enjoyable.

Now she is a cartoon villain and a cliché. It's sad that a character that debuted in a Joss Whedon movie has now become simple, boring, and predictable. For all the faults and failures that Age of Ultron has, it had characters.I am bored by Marvel Movies. I saw a reddit post that claimed they fell asleep when the music begun at the start of the movie. I understand that. That music means nothing anymore.I will watch Thor 4. I will watch Guardians 3.

But most multiverses that you see are when America charves opens a star portal and doctor strange go's through with her. There are only 2 and a half multiverses that they actually spend time in. So for a multiverse film, they should have had more multiverse in it.But the rest of the film was good. I do feel that strange should have had a bit more on screen time.

201,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,My experience was ruined by the trailers,"So... This is a good film. A great film. It has a crazy amount of action and the action is incredible. The CGI is kicked up to such heights that it sometimes surpasses Endgame. If you go expecting Dr. Strange and his cool powers, you get Dr. Strange and his cool powers.If you... suddenly expect certain characters to show up because of the trailers then you'll be disappointed. I'd say the trailers revealed 90% of the surprises. At least to me.That's not to say the film's surprises aren't spectacular. There's one particular character that shows up that made my jaw drop because of what I've seen in the what if series if you've watched that.The thing is the villain in this movie was incredible. I've never seen a marvel movie make a villain this scary before. Even green goblin doesn't match. But the whole time I was expecting some new crazy twist that would make me get up from the chair and cheer and it didn't happen. I was expecting something I hadn't seen from the trailers and it distracted me from appreciating the movie's finer details and gifts.There were some emotional moments that failed to affect me because I was too busy waiting for the whole universe to be ripped open and a thousand alternate universe avengers to descend and save the day and give me the bliss and joy I had been expecting. It didn't happen.This is a Dr. Strange movie and that's that. But looking back I realised it was a top tier movie by itself. There were some genuinely tense moments followed by real consequences, and real impact. It gave me that old school comic book vibe of anything can happen. I was thrilled.The action was so colorful so beautiful. Ever shot could have been a wallpaper. There are so many strange crazy things that happen in this film that make you feel like you're on a roller coaster but like I said if you're expecting this movie to be basically an avengers movie you won't get that.The film was a 7/10 because of my disappointment. If I hadn't watched the trailers it would have been a 9/10.Also Wanda is in this. A lot.

202,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,Doctor Strange: in the Multiverse of Madness,"Whatever your thoughts are about Marvel you have to give them credit for their worldbuilding and character development. Wanda and Dr. Strange are both very unique and gray characters which makes them fun. The actors also do a great job portraying their characters.Marvel has never been this dark before. I'm honestly surprised it hasn't got a higher age limit. But it's great with darker content. Marvel has for a long time felt too childish but this feels more real and got a stronger effect.The multiverse is a very confusing subject and it can ruin movies, but it can also make them more fun. This movie did a good job not making it too confusing while also utilizing it and creating fun fanservice.Like the previous Doctor Strange movie, the visual effects are spectacular and breathtaking. There are some scenes which are not quite as believable but it doesn't take the viewer out of the movie.The problem with these powerful magic characters is that they are too overpowered. There's a lot of plot armor, but it's almost impossible to avoid when you're playing with these powerful heroes.

Some of the scenes in the film were genuinely amazing, especially those involving the scarlet which going on a rampage (don't worry I won't go into detail in this review). But aside from the visuals and some genuinely great scenes the movie fall extremely short of expectations. The plot in the film is extremely weak, and the introduction of America Chavez was really underwhelming, she isn't a compelling character in the slightest, nothing against the actress, but the character herself just isn't good.

208,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,Sam Raimi in the The Multitask of Business,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, the latest cinematic entry from the MCU, delivers great CGI visuals, fantastic action sequences, and the occasional signature trademarks from Evil Dead director Sam Raimi.It is a crowd-pleasing popcorn film that rewards the most faithful fans who have kept up with all the films, recent TV shows, and the animated What If with tremendous fan service.In the end, the Multiverse of Madness is standard Marvel fare that does not deliver the promise its glorious movie title suggests. The script buckles under its weight serving different masters being a Doctor Strange sequel, a WandaVision sequel, a Sam Raimi film, and another chapter of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.First off, Michael Waldron's script took me by surprise. The trailers lead me to think the story was about something else than what we got, which was oddly smaller in scope than I expected.Like The Big Bang progressing to the theorized inevitable Big Crunch, the weight of the ever-expanding Marvel Universe is starting to cave in at the expense of the story, especially with the inclusion of a multiverse. These movies are starting to feel like weekly visits to the comic book store and reading a serial story with no end. I'm wary about that as that was why I stopped reading comic books serially in the first place and switched to graphic novels.Benedict Cumberbatch is a captivating actor and has made the Stephen Strange character his own, steering away from similarities to Tony Stark. Elizabeth Olson gives her best performance yet as Wanda Maximoff. The script gives her lots to play and she has the most range out of the cast.Sam Raimi's trademark B-movie horror movie elements are a breath of fresh air and fun. There are moments of terror and distress that parents should be aware of before taking children below the age of ten. When the horror sets in, it is treated like a contractually obligated time slot for Sam Raimi to take his turn and contribute his portion, as if the studio was saying, ""We did our bit, Sam. Now it's your turn. Go!""The first Doctor Strange was one of my favorite MCU solo films with the best cast full of character actors, trippy visuals, and firmly established an arc for Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange to grow in his next solo outing.Although these story elements are rightfully in place, The Multiverse of Madness does not pick up where the first movie left off satisfyingly. I wanted a deeper exploration of Doctor Strange as a character. What we got, the ""Are you happy, Doctor Strange?"", was telegraphed and unearned. This felt more of a sequel to Doctor Strange after the events of Infinity War and Spider-Man: No Way Home. I ultimately didn't feel the story was as emotionally compelling as the first Doctor Strange and it loses that initial earnestness, despite all its fun action sequences.","[['Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse', 'Madness', 'cinematic entry', 'MCU', 'CGI', 'fantastic action', 'the occasional signature', 'Evil Dead', 'director', 'Sam Raimi.It', 'a crowd-pleasing popcorn', 'film', 'recent TV', 'tremendous fan', 'the end', 'Multiverse', 'Madness', 'Marvel', 'fare', 'the promise', 'glorious movie', 'title'], ['The script', 'weight', 'Doctor Strange', 'sequel', 'WandaVision', 'sequel', 'Sam Raimi', 'film', 'another chapter', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe.First', 'Michael Waldron', 'script', 'surprise'], ['the story', 'something', 'scope', 'Big Bang', 'Big', 'Crunch', 'the weight', 'Marvel Universe', 'the expense', 'the story', 'the inclusion', 'a multiverse'], ['the comic book', 'store', 'a serial story', 'no end'], ['the first place', 'Cumberbatch', 'actor', 'Stephen Strange', 'Tony Stark'], ['Elizabeth Olson', 'performance', 'Wanda Maximoff'], ['The script', 'the cast.Sam', 'Raimi', 'trademark', 'B-movie', 'horror', 'movie', 'a breath', 'fresh air', 'fun'], ['terror', 'distress', 'the age', 'ten'], ['the horror', 'obligated time', 'slot', 'Sam Raimi', 'turn', 'portion', 'the studio', 'bit', 'Sam'], ['turn'], [], ['Doctor Strange', 'MCU', 'solo', 'cast', 'character', 'an arc', 'Benedict Cumberbatch', 'Doctor Strange', 'next solo', 'these story', 'place', 'Multiverse', 'Madness', 'the first movie'], ['exploration', 'Doctor Strange', 'a character'], ['Are', 'Doctor Strange'], [], ['a sequel', 'Doctor Strange', 'Infinity War', 'Spider-Man', 'Way Home'], ['the story', 'Doctor Strange', 'initial earnestness', 'fun action']]","[['Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse of Madness', 'cinematic entry', 'MCU', 'CGI visuals', 'action sequences', 'signature trademarks', 'Evil Dead director Sam Raimi.It', 'popcorn film', 'faithful fans', 'films', 'TV shows', 'tremendous fan', 'end', 'Multiverse of Madness', 'Marvel fare', 'promise', 'movie title'], ['script', 'weight', 'different masters', 'Doctor Strange sequel', 'WandaVision sequel', 'Sam Raimi film', 'chapter', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe.First', 'Michael Waldron', 'script', 'surprise'], ['trailers', 'story', 'something', 'scope', 'Big Bang', 'Big Crunch', 'weight', 'Marvel Universe', 'expense', 'story', 'inclusion', 'multiverse'], ['movies', 'weekly visits', 'book store', 'serial story', 'end'], ['comic books', 'first place', 'novels.Benedict Cumberbatch', 'actor', 'Stephen Strange', 'similarities', 'Tony Stark'], ['Elizabeth Olson', 'performance', 'Wanda Maximoff'], ['script', 'lots', 'cast.Sam Raimi', 'trademark B-movie horror movie elements', 'breath', 'fresh air and fun'], ['moments of terror', 'distress that parents', 'children', 'age of ten'], ['horror', 'time slot', 'Sam Raimi', 'turn', 'portion', 'studio', 'bit', 'Sam'], ['turn'], [], ['Doctor Strange', 'MCU solo films', 'cast', 'character actors', 'trippy visuals', 'arc for Benedict Cumberbatch', 'Doctor Strange', 'next solo', 'story elements', 'place', 'Multiverse of Madness', 'first movie'], ['exploration of Doctor Strange', 'character'], ['Are', 'Doctor Strange'], [], ['sequel', 'Doctor Strange', 'events of Infinity War', 'Spider-Man', 'Way Home'], ['story', 'Doctor Strange', 'initial earnestness', 'action sequences']]"

She should still have a greater common sense about his action and the drawback to be other universe mother.Even at the end, she is realized that in her possesses form. And that action destroy every madness she has been doing for this movie plot.Sacrifice herself to destroy darkhold in every universe, is it really important ?

217,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,The Wonder Woman 1984 of the MCU,"Spoilers here!I wasn't expecting the best MCU outing but I definitely did not expect this to be the worst. It has overtaken Ant Man as my least favourite.Dr Strange 2 is a mess lets face it. The tone is all wrong for starters. I do like Sam Raimi but his style is just not suited to Dr Strange. It doesn't know if it wants to be a superhero movie, horror, action, romance, drama or love story. It fails at all of them.This is not necessarily a bad movie, the special effects are actually quite good and BC is good in the title role.Of course they have to include the obligatory woke nonsense (which is getting nauseating). We get it, LGBTI diverse people are the greatest in the world! We get it now, stop preaching to us already and get back to making good movies.Now for the cameos. Again, spoiler alert!!As expected Patrick Stewart does appear as Professor X, as does Agent Carter as diverse female Cpt America, there is also diverse female cpt Marvel and the first appearance in the MCU of Mr Fantastic. This is all well and good but then They are only in it for 5 mins before being killed off! WTH?!

218,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,"Loved parts, hated parts, it's so mixed","POSITIVES:1) Benedict Cumberbatch is so likeable and engaging in the lead role. He's a brilliant actor and I thought he did a terrific job with the material. The ongoing theme of whether Dr Strange is happy really worked for me emotionally, as did most of the films emotional moments
2) The film allowed Sam Raimi to have more influence than I was expecting. It was still very clearly a Marvel film, but Raimi's signature horror style definitely shone through and the film was all the better for it. Some of the horror imagery and scenes were incredible
3) I was very impressed with the way the film turned Wanda into a proper villain. Marvel normally struggles with committing to anything dark or out of the box, but I was really happy that they did so here. Having watched WandaVision, I thought the film continued the themes of that show really well. I like the characters of Tommy and Billy a lot too
4) Seeing Patrick Stewart return as Charles Xavier was clearly fan service but it was still amazingNEGATIVES:1) Some of the special effects were notably poor and that is not acceptable on a film that cost $200 million to make
2) I didn't like the way in which the film effectively redeemed Wanda at the end. It felt like Marvel taking the easy option and I sincerely hope Wanda is never seen again, but I doubt that will be the case
3) A lot of the film's logic made no sense to me. I ended up thinking Dr Strange was actually quite a hypocrite for a lot of the things he was okay with / not okay with. That has frustrated me more and more the more that I've thought about the film.4) Neither of the end credit scenes were remotely worth staying for.","[['POSITIVES:1', 'Benedict Cumberbatch', 'the lead role'], ['a brilliant actor', 'a terrific', 'job', 'the material'], ['The ongoing theme', 'Dr Strange', 'The film', 'Sam Raimi', 'influence'], ['Marvel', 'film', 'Raimi', 'signature', 'horror', 'style', 'the film'], ['the horror', 'imagery', 'the way', 'the film', 'Wanda', 'a proper villain'], ['Marvel', 'anything', 'dark', 'the box'], ['WandaVision', 'the film', 'that show'], ['Tommy', 'Billy', 'a lot', 'Patrick Stewart', 'return', 'Charles Xavier', 'fan service', 'a film', 'the way', 'the film', 'Wanda', 'the end'], ['Marvel', 'the easy option', 'Wanda', 'the case', 'A lot', 'the film', 'logic', 'no sense'], ['Dr Strange', 'a hypocrite', 'a lot', '/'], ['the film.4', 'the end', 'credit']]","[['POSITIVES:1', 'Benedict Cumberbatch', 'lead role'], ['brilliant actor', 'terrific job', 'material'], ['theme of whether Dr Strange', 'films', 'emotional moments', 'film', 'Sam Raimi', 'influence'], ['Marvel film', 'Raimi', 'signature horror style', 'film'], ['horror imagery', 'scenes', 'way', 'film', 'Wanda', 'proper villain'], ['Marvel', 'anything dark', 'box'], ['WandaVision', 'film', 'themes', 'show'], ['characters of Tommy', 'Billy', 'lot', 'Patrick Stewart return', 'Charles Xavier', 'fan service', 'special effects', 'film', 'way', 'film', 'Wanda', 'end'], ['Marvel', 'easy option', 'Wanda', 'case', 'lot', 'film', 'logic', 'sense'], ['Dr Strange', 'hypocrite', 'lot', 'things', '/'], ['film.4', 'end credit scenes']]"

Her motive, while honorable, valid, and understandable, is one-dimensional. As a villain, she become evil; she isn't inherently evil.

237,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,Please read my review before disliking it.,"I went to see the movie on the morning (10 am) of the 4th of May and waited two days before making a review in order to see what other people tought of the movie. I was surprised in seeing how many people actually disliked the movie. I get that people have different likings but if you hated the movie because it did not give you an absurd amount of cameos then you shouldn't have overhyped it. I will avoid making spoilers but we got 7 cameos in the movie: 1 in the post credit, 3 normal ones during the movie and 3 massive ones that made canon to the MCU 3 different groups. This is enough cameos for one movie. As for the movie itself I was glued to my seat the whole time, from beginning to end. I would have prefered the original cut of the movie but Marvel needed to reshoot things in order to be able to let kids watch the movie. Same treatment both Morbius and Venom got. Nontheless the movie was able to be dark and violent (if you've seen the movie you know I'm talking about one scene in particular). Another thing I see people complain about were the mothers of America Chavez. I do not care if you dislike LGBT or what, you do you, but hating a movie for a 30 seconds scene it's absurd.

238,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,A full-blown Sam Raimi film!,"My biggest fear was that Marvel wouldn't let Sam Raimi do his thing. Thankfully, that's not the case at all. Sam Raimi goes ham on this movie.A script like this would not have worked in the hands of any other director. Raimi turns what could've been an incomprehensible mess into a visually inventive and occasionally gruesome adventure. The flaws in the script are still there, but the fantastic direction always makes sure you're not thinking too hard about them. This is easily the best directed movie in the MCU.The movie has fanservice for both Marvel and Sam Raimi fans. There are moments that are clearly direct references to the Evil Dead movies, and a number of comic book characters make suprise appearances.These moments surprisingly never distracted me from the story, which while often too chaotic for its own good, finds a strong anchor point in the emotional journeys of Stephen Strange and Wanda Maximoff.I have no idea how this movie will hold up on a rewatch, since it definitely has flaws, but right now, I'm just extremely happy to have an MCU film not afraid to let its director put every bit of themselves on screen.","[['fear', 'Marvel', 'Sam Raimi', 'thing'], ['the case'], ['Sam Raimi', 'this movie.A script', 'any other director'], ['Raimi', 'an incomprehensible mess', 'gruesome adventure'], ['the script', 'the fantastic direction'], ['directed movie', 'MCU.The', 'movie', 'Marvel', 'Sam Raimi'], ['Evil Dead', 'a number', 'comic book', 'suprise', 'the story', 'a strong anchor', 'point', 'the emotional journeys', 'Stephen Strange', 'Wanda Maximoff.I', 'no idea', 'this movie', 'a rewatch', 'MCU', 'film', 'director', 'every bit', 'screen']]","[['fear', 'Marvel', 'Sam Raimi', 'thing'], ['case'], ['Sam Raimi', 'movie.A script', 'hands', 'other director'], ['Raimi', 'incomprehensible mess', 'gruesome adventure'], ['flaws', 'script', 'fantastic direction'], ['directed movie', 'MCU.The movie', 'Marvel', 'Sam Raimi fans'], ['moments', 'direct references', 'Evil Dead movies', 'number', 'book characters', 'suprise', 'appearances.These moments', 'story', 'anchor point', 'journeys of Stephen Strange', 'Wanda Maximoff.I', 'idea', 'movie', 'rewatch', 'flaws', 'MCU film', 'director', 'bit', 'screen']]"

The only character that they not spoil is mr fantastic.

0,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2: Exceeds already high expectations,"Despite being a huge comic book nerd I was not familiar with the Guardians before the first movie came out. I did some googling and upon learning about this sci-fi superhero team consisting of a talking raccoon and tree man I was hardly impressed.I finally got round to watching the first film and was blown away. It had a remarkable charm that even the other Marvel titles didn't have. It was filled with great humour, memorable moments and fit into the Marvel Universe long running story perfectly.Because of this I pumped by expectations up high for the sequel to a degree where it was almost guaranteed to fail yet somehow, someway it didn't.Not only did it meet my expectations but it exceeded them, GotG2 is amazing.Full of the same five star humour, being a visual treat and once again with an excellent soundtrack the film gripped me from the outset and delivered that charm all over again.This time including several industry veterans including Kurt Russell (Who has been on great form since his return) and Sylvester Stallone they fit in well and don't detract from the franchise as I feared they might.With cameo appearances along the way from the likes of Farscape (1999) lead Ben Browder to industry legend Seth Green as Howard the Duck this is a fun rollercoaster ride than left me positively gagging for more.This is one of those films I feel like I could rant about (In a positive way) for a while and so I'm going to resist the urge and merely say that Guardians 2 is a contender for the best Marvel movie, contested only by the first Avengers film.Masterpiece.The Good:Cast are great againCharm returnsExcellent nostalgic soundtrackLooks amazingThe Bad:Only one movie with Baby Groot?

1,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Do me! Do me! Do me!,"Quill finds his real father.This is an enjoyable adventure with great humour and character moments.The story is pretty threadbare outside of the development of characters like Quill, Yondu, Ego, and Nebula but this provides enough entertainment on its own. Written into most scenes are strong themes about family and friendship. What it means to be a parent. Surrogate parents and families. Estranged children searching for parental figures and family.Of course it's all done with a great sense of humour, as characters like Drax, Mantis, Rocket, and Groot light up the screen with strong verbal and visual comedy.Quill doesn't massively develop as a character, but we do learn more about his origins and powers. Alongside this the Guardians are portrayed as developing a family dynamic. This is great idea given they are all depicted as coming from traumatic beginnings.Ego is an interesting character and fantastic visualisation of an outlandish graphic-novel concept. It is not particularly subtle, but the character epitomises an extreme version of the in-built selfish drives present in everyone. Kurt Russell is on great form.The contrasting father figure of Yondu is written particularly well. He has been portrayed as having egotistical characteristics too, but here is given a huge redemption arc with with moments of great altruism. It is great to see Michael Rooker playing this type of character. He is as stereotypically violent and generally aggressive as in his previous roles, but for once he gets to show some heart.Nebula and Gamora have solid moments of relationship development. These scenes all tie in well to the movie's main themes and are important to the overarching narrative of the MCU, particularly when watching The Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame. Karen Gillan and Zoe Zaldana both give strong performances, especially Gillan who is a consistently strong performer in the MCU.Visually it is a colourful feast for the eyes and full of exciting spectacle as you would expect from a space adventure. For me the CGI action is a little too much on occasions and distracts from the story, but doesn't spoil my enjoyment of the movie. It generally tells the story through its cinematography and editing. Being a Guardians movie it has a great soundtrack of course with many a well placed song.","[['Quill', 'real father.This', 'an enjoyable adventure', 'great humour', 'character', 'moments.The', 'story', 'the development', 'Quill', 'Yondu', 'Ego', 'Nebula', 'enough entertainment'], ['family', 'friendship'], ['a parent'], ['Surrogate'], ['Estranged', 'family.Of course', 'a great sense', 'humour', 'Drax', 'Mantis', 'Rocket', 'Groot', 'the screen', 'visual comedy.Quill', 'a character'], ['a family', 'dynamic'], ['great idea', 'traumatic beginnings.Ego', 'an interesting character', 'fantastic visualisation', 'an outlandish graphic-novel', 'concept'], ['the character', 'an extreme version', 'everyone'], ['Kurt Russell', 'great form.The', 'father figure', 'Yondu'], ['a huge redemption', 'arc', 'great altruism'], ['Michael Rooker', 'this type', 'character'], ['some heart.Nebula', 'Gamora', 'relationship', 'development'], ['all tie', 'the movie', 'narrative', 'MCU', 'Infinity War', 'Endgame'], ['Karen Gillan', 'Zoe Zaldana', 'Gillan', 'strong performer', 'MCU.Visually', 'a colourful feast', 'spectacle', 'a space', 'adventure'], ['CGI', 'action', 'the story', 'enjoyment', 'the movie'], ['the story', 'cinematography', 'editing'], ['movie', 'a great soundtrack', 'course', 'song']]","[['Quill', 'real father.This', 'enjoyable adventure', 'great humour', 'character moments.The story', 'development of characters', 'Quill', 'Yondu', 'Ego', 'Nebula', 'enough entertainment'], ['scenes', 'themes about family', 'friendship'], ['parent'], ['Surrogate parents', 'families'], ['Estranged children', 'parental figures', 'family.Of course', 'sense of humour', 'characters like Drax', 'Mantis', 'Rocket', 'Groot', 'screen', 'strong verbal', 'visual comedy.Quill', 'character', 'origins and powers'], ['Guardians', 'family dynamic'], ['great idea', 'traumatic beginnings.Ego', 'interesting character', 'fantastic visualisation', 'graphic-novel concept'], ['character', 'extreme version', 'in-built selfish drives', 'everyone'], ['Kurt Russell', 'great form.The', 'figure of Yondu'], ['egotistical characteristics', 'redemption arc', 'moments', 'great altruism'], ['Michael Rooker', 'type of character'], ['previous roles', 'heart.Nebula and Gamora', 'moments of relationship development'], ['scenes', 'tie', 'movie', 'main themes', 'narrative', 'MCU', 'Avengers', 'Infinity War', 'Endgame'], ['Karen Gillan', 'Zoe Zaldana', 'strong performances', 'Gillan', 'strong performer', 'MCU.Visually', 'colourful feast', 'eyes', 'spectacle', 'space adventure'], ['CGI action', 'occasions and distracts', 'story', 'enjoyment', 'movie'], ['story', 'cinematography and editing'], ['Guardians movie', 'soundtrack of course', 'song']]"
2,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Fantastic,"It has its moments where it may crack a joke at the wrong time- but Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is easily one of the best sequels i've ever seen- and without a doubt- an absolute blast. I knew from the minute I saw the trailer for the first film that Guardians of the Galaxy was going to be something special, and the same thing applies to this film. We get the iconic characters back in all their glory, as well as some new ones. The entire cast is great, there is no doubting any of the main 5's performances, as they are simply as great as before. What I do enjoy about this film is how they decided to make Nebula less of a 2D character and really provide the depth they didn't have time for her character in the first film. We also get an excellent performance from Kurt Russell as the God Ego- as well as newcomer Pom Klementieff's hilarious portrayal of Mantis, and of course the brilliant Michael Rooker as Yondu. The soundtrack is great, obviously, and Gunn's direction is so excellently crafted and visually sound that you can't help but feel every aspect of emotion he is going for while making it. It's an incredibly funny film, with some great action scenes, and a deeply emotional turmoil that honestly made me cry once...or twice. The visuals are also fantastic, as well as the makeup, and the look of the film is incredibly well developed- as well as its style and atmosphere. In the end, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is everything you would hope the sequel would be and more. It may not be quite as good as the original, but it certainly is more than a worthy successor.My Rating: 9.9/10.","[['a joke', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['a doubt-', 'an absolute', 'blast'], ['the minute', 'the trailer', 'the first film', 'Galaxy', 'something', 'the same thing', 'this film'], ['glory'], ['The entire cast'], ['this film', 'Nebula', 'character', 'the depth', 'time', 'character', 'the first film'], ['an excellent performance', 'Kurt Russell', 'God Ego-', 'Pom Klementieff', 'hilarious portrayal', 'Mantis', 'course', 'Michael Rooker', 'Yondu'], ['The soundtrack', 'Gunn', 'direction', 'every aspect', 'emotion'], ['funny film', 'some great action', 'a deeply emotional turmoil', 'cry'], ['the makeup', 'the look', 'the film', 'style'], ['the end', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['everything', 'the sequel'], ['a worthy successor.My', 'Rating']]","[['moments', 'joke', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['sequels', 'doubt-', 'absolute blast'], ['minute', 'trailer', 'film that Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'something', 'thing applies', 'film'], ['iconic characters', 'glory', 'new ones'], ['entire cast', 'performances'], ['film', 'Nebula', 'character', 'depth', 'time', 'character', 'first film'], ['performance from Kurt Russell', 'God Ego-', 'Pom Klementieff', 'portrayal of Mantis', 'course', 'Michael Rooker', 'Yondu'], ['soundtrack', 'Gunn', 'direction', 'aspect of emotion'], ['funny film', 'action scenes', 'deeply emotional turmoil', 'cry'], ['visuals', 'makeup', 'look', 'film', 'style'], ['end', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['everything', 'sequel'], ['successor.My Rating']]"
3,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Yes. Just yes,"My god, I did not expect this movie to be this good. I am a big fan of the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie, and while I do think it is one of the better MCU movies, this one is just better in practically every way. The plot is well structured, and the pacing is great. The movie also explores its characters way more thoroughly than the previous one. The struggle of finding a place where you belong is a central theme, and every important character has their own struggles related to this. The performances are great as usual, every actor really brings their own flavor to their character. The movie also has great visuals, with all the wacky and fun ideas you might expect from a space movie. The action scenes are great, and the cgi is pretty flawless. The movie is also way funnier than any other MCU movie, with every character being a great source of humor. It's so much comedy being presented it's actually a little too much for me sometimes. Some of the characters feel like they exist only to be comic relief, even though they also have serious struggles that deserve a more serious treatment than they get. That is my only complaint though, as this is a movie with great plot, characters and visuals, as well as a fantastic climax, even though they pulled the whole ""saving the world""-plot point again.

12,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Guardians' date with the creator.,"The first film was the most unexpected. That was one of the most colourfull space films I have ever seen. Youthful, energetic, fantastic visuals and so the same followed in this sequel as well. Not the same good, but stood to the expectation of the first film's success. This story does not have a great adventure in the galaxy. A simple quest, but a thrilling action-adventure. Now this accidental space gang is set to meet the creator.It's time for Peter to meet his father, Ego. As he still upset with his mother's death, his encounter with his father was not as expectedly smooth. On the other side of the story, Rocket, Yandu, Baby Groot make their escape from the captivity. They all end up on the Ego's planet where the rest of the film going to take place. Being the guardians of the galaxy, their fight against the whoever threaten the safety of the universe once again tested with their strength as a team.James Gunn did it again. And I'm confident that he's going to do the same for next as well. All the actors were fantastic like the previous film. This time, little fun with little Groot. Anybody who loved the first would love it too. Being a franchise from Marvel universe, it is yet to join the 'Avengers'. So far so good. I'm now expecting one of the best of best trilogies.

First off the movie is very funny, the humour is quite particular so if you don't like one joke you probably won't like the rest, but if you do it's hilarious! The comedy is actually well timed as well, it isn't thrown in at random points that disrupt the flow of the movie. The plot is also decent, it's not the best part of the film but definitely respectable. The section with the golden people(can't remember their names), while being a big part of the plot that is quite necessary, gets a bit repetitive with them constantly chasing the guardians. Much like the first movie I think the best part of this movie is the character. Undoubtedly what makes these movies so good is how well each character interacts with one another. Not only that but most of them have genuine development that has meaning that leaves the ending to be quite impactful. The movie excellently balances every character while leaving more room for them to grow and plenty of directions for future films. The villain is a bit mediocre, still works well and the acting by Kurt Russell really makes you hat the character...which is perfect. Oh and this movie looks absolutely beautiful, I never really noticed before but this movie was way ahead of its time...the camera work, the colours...everything is just amazing!

Also the scene where Rocket, Groot, Yondu, and Kraglin jumped 177 systems and their faces became distorted was hilarious. Lastly, once again, Drax and his stupidity stole the show, he is just hilarious. This movie also had a good plot. I thought it was cool how they tied in Peter's issue with losing his mother and not knowing who his father is. The acting of the new addition, Mantis was great, I think Pom Klementieff played Mantis perfectly, it is a very unique character to play and she was great.

19,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Far too much lame humour.,"God-like space traveller Ego (Kurt Russell) reveals to Peter Quill (AKA Starlord) that he is his father and tries to convince his new-found son to become part of his plan to assimilate the entire universe.I'm one of the few who didn't enjoy the humour in the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie: I just didn't find it funny. So you can probably guess how I feel about Vol. 2, which ramps up the level of comedy even further. I can't say I'm disappointed that James Gunn won't be directing part three (although I do think he was treated very unfairly by those in charge).But Vol. 2 doesn't just suffer from an excess of bad gags: the plot is weak, the pop soundtrack is overbearing, at 136 minutes it's way too long, and the action is too far-fetched (even for a comic book sci-fi film featuring a talking raccoon and a dancing baby tree). Our heroes are thrown into numerous situations that would reasonably result in a very messy fate, yet they repeatedly manage to emerge unscathed. Suspending disbelief is one thing; accepting that a character can escape certain death time and time again is asking too much.Admittedly, Gunn has produced a film that looks great, with some mind boggling special effects and mesmerisingly beautiful scenes that make wonderful use of colour, but with such a silly plot and execution that frequently defies logic and the laws of physics, it's hard to care too much about what happens to the good guys.In short, this is the second best film to co-star Sylvester Stallone and Michael Rooker, Cliffhanger still clinging firmly on to first place.5/10, simply for sexy insect alien Mantis (Pom Klementieff) and tasty blue bald cyborg Nebula (Karen Gillan), both of whom make watching just about worthwhile.","[['God-like space', 'traveller', 'Ego', 'Kurt Russell', 'Peter Quill', 'AKA Starlord', 'father', 'new-found son', 'part', 'plan', 'the entire universe.I', 'the humour', 'Galaxy', 'movie'], ['Vol'], ['the level', 'comedy'], ['James Gunn', 'part', 'charge', 'Vol'], ['an excess', 'the plot', 'the pop', 'soundtrack', 'way', 'the action', 'a comic book', 'sci-fi film', 'raccoon', 'a dancing', 'baby', 'tree'], ['messy fate'], ['disbelief', 'thing', 'a character', 'certain death', 'time', 'time', 'Gunn', 'a film', 'some mind', 'wonderful use', 'colour', 'a silly plot', 'execution', 'logic', 'the good guys.In', 'film', 'co-star', 'Sylvester Stallone', 'Michael Rooker', 'Cliffhanger', 'first place.5/10', 'sexy insect alien', 'Mantis', 'Pom Klementieff', 'tasty blue', 'bald', 'cyborg', 'Nebula', 'Karen Gillan', 'watching']]","[['space traveller Ego', 'Kurt Russell', 'Peter Quill', 'AKA Starlord', 'father and tries', 'new-found son', 'part', 'plan', 'entire universe.I', 'humour', 'first Guardians', 'Galaxy movie'], ['Vol'], ['level of comedy'], ['James Gunn', 'part', 'charge', 'Vol'], ['excess', 'bad gags', 'plot', 'pop soundtrack', 'minutes', 'way', 'action', 'comic book', 'sci-fi film', 'raccoon', 'dancing baby tree'], ['heroes', 'numerous situations', 'messy fate'], ['disbelief', 'thing', 'character', 'death time', 'time', 'Gunn', 'film', 'mind', 'special effects', 'beautiful scenes', 'use of colour', 'silly plot and execution', 'logic', 'laws of physics', 'good guys.In', 'film', 'co-star Sylvester Stallone', 'Michael Rooker', 'Cliffhanger', 'first place.5/10', 'alien Mantis', 'Pom Klementieff', 'blue bald cyborg Nebula', 'Karen Gillan', 'watching']]"
20,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,The sequel we've been looking for,"Of course the first one came completely from out of nowhere. Well not in a sense that no one knew the movie was being made or came out in the cinema. But no one expected anything from it. And it became this larger than life thing. With characters so well written and with just enough swagger and good dialog/one-liners, it's almost crazy that no one expected this would be great.So now it is expected, so how does it fair? Pretty good I'd say. We have established the characters, we know their traits and we can have fun. Even with conventions in general, breaking fourth walls and all (when it comes to love relationships for example). Of course if you haven't seen the first one, you may have issues with the movie. I've seen a couple of reviews where it was clear, they hadn't seen the first one. And while I do think this does work as a standalone, I'd say it may be risky when it comes to you liking this or not.The humor is there though and as we come to understand in the Marvel Universe, there are added scenes in and after the credits. Five in total to be exact! So sit back and enjoy them - if you had a good time watching the movie that is.

21,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,The Spirit of FARSCAPE lives here,"As does John Crichton, who is playing the Sovereign ""Admiral""- complete with ""Peacekeeper"" NZ style accent. Peacekeepers were not gold, though.But one could make an argument that Peter Quill is a kind of John Crichton, and that Gamora is a type of Aeryn Sun (Gamora, like Aeryn, can lift up heavy objects with no problems at all). Peter Quill is an earthling who was snatched up by aliens, actually by Yondo, in much the same way John Crichton was sucked down a wormhole. So in some ways Peter is as out of place as John was during the 88 times we got to see him in the uncharted and tormented territories of space.We could even say that Drax is a stupider Ka D'argo and that Rocket is an equally funny Rygel, except that he is a raccoon rather than a helium-farting frog.Yondo can even be a Scorpius, Mantis a Chiana that is attracted to Drax/D'argo, Nebula a Jool or Shikozou.However you mix it up, the characters and the stories and the comedy is so much like Farscape. Actually come to think about it at the end of ""the peacekeeper wars"" which was the end of the Farscape franchise, John Crichton's Best friend is lost. Something similar to that happens in this film, and that just solidifies the relationship between the two franchises.It almost makes us want to see a Farscape sequel or a continuation produced by James Gunn because we know he would handle the property properly.As far as the freakin guardians of the galaxy (except I didn't say freakin'), this installment has so much more in it compared to the first one.

23,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Guardians is back and has plenty of visuals and action. A great second chapter in GotG.,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is back and flashy as ever when it comes to its visual style of action, soundtrack, a fun cast, and the laughable humor. Usually sequels can be a let down after its predecessor set the standards high. And the build up momentum for the sequels is easily forgotten. Writer/Director James Gunn manages to continue what worked on the first movie and expand further with the characters he brought together. Yes, it is a ragtag of misfits that try to be a team and argue to each other with their own personal issues. In the end, they see each other not as friends but family. The plot follows Peter (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), and Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) are tasked at fighting away a giant monster and protecting valuable batteries. Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki) the leader of the sovereign race, who needed the guardians help for the task. After a dispute, leaving the guardians on the run away from Ayesha and her army of drones chasing them away. The guardians crash on a planet, where they come across Ego (Kurt Russell) who is Peter's father. Ego takes Peter, Gamora, and Drax to his planet. Meanwhile, Rocket, Groot, and Nebula (Karen Gillan) stay behind their wrecked ship, only to come across the Ravagers led by Yondu (Michael Rooker). Trying to claim the bounty on the guardians that is set by Ayesha. Guardians of the Galaxy 2 has everything you can expect. It has plenty of action and the visual effects were colorful, and impressive. When Peter and his team visit Ego's planet. The visual effects were astonishing. The set pieces were great too. It does have its fun share of humor. It is fun to see a dysfunctional team trying to get along; you have Peter and Rocket with their arrogant cocky self. Nebula and Gamora personal conflict that keeps them fighting each other. The one thing that always drives Peter and his team is how they see each other as family. Also, there is baby groot which is always a scene stealer. Groot is small and cute, even from the opening moment of him dancing and needing music playing as the guardians are fighting against a giant monster. The villains are usually what worry me, as several Marvel movies later. They all have that same motive and have that cliché routine. I was worried for a second in this film about who and what the villain was. Without giving away spoilers or details. This film villain is by far better compared to the first movie. Definitely, the villain does not show until later. It definitely leads the direction into a big climax with the guardians trying to save the galaxy yet again. The guardians are tested personally as Peter, Gamora, and Drax are separated from Groot and Rocket being with Yondu. Gunn never lets a single moment become dull. There are easter eggs, celebrity cameos, etc. Also, there are five mid/post credit scenes that are worth checking out unlike the first movie end scene of Howard the Duck that was a waste. Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a visually exciting sequel that surpasses the original. It has a fun cast and characters, the soundtrack is awesome, the visual effects and action is exciting, the villain is an interesting one, and James Gunn's fun direction makes it a flashy fun movie.","[['Galaxy Vol'], ['flashy', 'visual style', 'action', 'soundtrack', 'a fun', 'cast', 'the laughable humor'], ['a let', 'predecessor'], ['the build', 'momentum'], ['Writer/Director James Gunn', 'the first movie'], ['a ragtag', 'a team', 'argue'], ['the end', 'family'], ['The plot', 'Peter', 'Chris Pratt', 'Gamora', 'Zoe Saldana', 'Drax', 'Dave Bautista', 'Rocket', 'Bradley Cooper', 'Baby Groot', 'Vin Diesel', 'a giant monster'], ['Ayesha', 'Elizabeth Debicki', 'the leader', 'the sovereign race', 'the task'], ['a dispute', 'Ayesha', 'army'], ['a planet', 'Ego', 'Kurt Russell', 'Peter', 'father'], ['Ego', 'Peter', 'Gamora', 'Drax', 'planet'], ['Rocket', 'Groot', 'Nebula', 'Karen Gillan', 'wrecked ship', 'Ravagers', 'Yondu', 'Michael Rooker'], ['the bounty', 'Ayesha'], ['Galaxy', 'everything'], ['plenty', 'action'], ['Peter', 'team', 'visit', 'Ego', 'planet'], [], ['The set'], ['fun', 'share', 'humor'], ['a dysfunctional team', 'Peter', 'Rocket', 'arrogant cocky self'], ['Nebula', 'Gamora', 'personal conflict'], ['thing', 'Peter', 'team', 'family'], ['baby', 'groot', 'a scene', 'stealer'], ['Groot', 'cute', 'the opening moment', 'music', 'playing', 'a giant monster'], ['Marvel'], ['same motive', 'that cliché', 'routine'], ['this film', 'the villain'], [], ['This film', 'villain', 'the first movie'], ['the villain'], ['the direction', 'a big climax', 'the galaxy'], ['Peter', 'Gamora', 'Drax', 'Groot', 'Rocket', 'Yondu'], ['Gunn', 'a single moment'], ['celebrity', 'cameos'], ['credit', 'the first movie', 'end', 'scene', 'Howard', 'Duck', 'a waste'], ['Galaxy Vol'], ['exciting sequel'], ['a fun', 'cast', 'the soundtrack', 'action', 'the villain', 'James Gunn', 'fun direction', 'a flashy fun', 'movie']]","[['Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['flashy', 'style of action', 'soundtrack', 'fun cast', 'laughable humor'], ['sequels', 'let', 'predecessor', 'standards'], ['build', 'momentum', 'sequels'], ['Writer/Director James Gunn', 'first movie', 'characters'], ['ragtag of misfits', 'team and argue', 'own personal issues'], ['end', 'friends but family'], ['plot', 'Peter', 'Chris Pratt', 'Gamora', 'Zoe Saldana', 'Drax', 'Dave Bautista', 'Rocket', 'Bradley Cooper', 'Baby Groot', 'Vin Diesel', 'giant monster', 'valuable batteries'], ['Ayesha', 'Elizabeth Debicki', 'leader', 'sovereign race', 'guardians', 'task'], ['dispute', 'guardians', 'Ayesha', 'army of drones'], ['guardians', 'planet', 'Ego', 'Kurt Russell', 'Peter', 'father'], ['Ego', 'Peter', 'Gamora', 'Drax', 'planet'], ['Rocket', 'Groot', 'Nebula', 'Karen Gillan', 'wrecked ship', 'Ravagers', 'Yondu', 'Michael Rooker'], ['bounty', 'guardians', 'Ayesha'], ['Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'everything'], ['plenty of action', 'visual effects'], ['Peter', 'team visit Ego', 'planet'], ['visual effects'], ['set pieces'], ['fun share', 'humor'], ['dysfunctional team', 'Peter and Rocket', 'arrogant cocky self'], ['Nebula and Gamora', 'personal conflict'], ['thing', 'Peter', 'team', 'family'], ['baby groot', 'scene stealer'], ['Groot', 'cute', 'opening moment', 'music playing', 'guardians', 'giant monster'], ['villains', 'Marvel movies'], ['same motive', 'cliché routine'], ['film', 'villain'], ['spoilers or details'], ['film villain', 'first movie'], ['villain'], ['direction', 'big climax', 'guardians', 'galaxy'], ['guardians', 'Peter', 'Gamora', 'Drax', 'Groot and Rocket', 'Yondu'], ['Gunn', 'single moment'], ['eggs', 'celebrity cameos'], ['credit scenes', 'movie end scene', 'Howard', 'Duck', 'waste'], ['Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['exciting sequel'], ['fun cast', 'characters', 'soundtrack', 'visual effects and action', 'villain', 'James Gunn', 'fun direction', 'fun movie']]"

26,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Almost as funny and charming as the first,"As someone who was floored by the first film, I was eager to see how the second installment in Gunn's trilogy(yes, it's a trilogy now) would pan out. To be honest, I was a bit anxious, as we are familiar with Hollywoods track record when it comes to sequels. However there are rare moments when the sequel lives up to it's predecessor. As is the case here, as Gunn delivers the same charm, humor and emotion as the first film. The big difference is the focus on Peter's story, As our heroin meets his long lost father Ego(brilliantly played by Kurt Russell), who shows up at the knick of time, as Rocket pisses off Ayesha(Elizabeth Debicki) who sends a space armada after them. To add the cherry on top of this pie is the soundtrack(Sam Cooke's Bring it on Home to Me), that was meticulously chosen. If you were a fan of the first, don't doubt, Gunn delivers a space opera that lives up to it's hype. I have high hopes for the future of the MCU, it's clear that the studio let Gunn's creativity speak for itself and boy did he have a lot to say.","[['someone', 'the first film', 'the second installment', 'Gunn', 'trilogy', 'a trilogy'], ['a bit', 'Hollywoods', 'track', 'record'], ['the sequel', 'predecessor'], ['the case', 'Gunn', 'the same charm', 'humor', 'emotion', 'the first film'], ['The big difference', 'the focus', 'Peter', 'story', 'heroin', 'father', 'Ego', 'Kurt Russell', 'the knick', 'time', 'Rocket', 'Ayesha', 'Elizabeth Debicki', 'a space', 'armada'], ['the cherry', 'top', 'this pie', 'the soundtrack', 'Sam Cooke', 'Bring', 'Home', 'Me'], ['a fan', 'Gunn', 'a space', 'opera', 'hype'], ['the future', 'MCU', 'the studio', 'Gunn', 'creativity', 'speak', 'a lot']]","[['someone', 'first film', 'installment in Gunn', 'trilogy', 'trilogy'], ['bit', 'Hollywoods track record', 'sequels'], ['rare moments', 'sequel', 'predecessor'], ['case', 'Gunn', 'same charm', 'humor and emotion', 'first film'], ['big difference', 'focus on Peter', 'story', 'heroin', 'father Ego', 'Kurt Russell', 'knick of time', 'Rocket', 'Ayesha', 'Elizabeth Debicki', 'space armada'], ['cherry on top', 'pie', 'soundtrack', 'Sam Cooke', 'Bring', 'Home', 'Me'], ['fan', 'Gunn', 'space opera', 'hype'], ['high hopes', 'future', 'MCU', 'studio', 'Gunn', 'creativity speak', 'lot']]"
27,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Father and Son Connection,"The first ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" was a welcome surprise, with engaging characters, funny lines, and a great portrayal of friendship in the most unexpected places. Times goes on, and relationships evolve and deepen in most cases. So in the end, there's plenty of action, back stories are connected, and it sort of makes sense.The gang is at the center of mess started by Rocket when he steals some valuable items from their employers. Retaliation promptly involves a gang of thugs in pursue of our gang, and things become more complicated with the arrival of Peter's long lost father. This results in a series of interesting moments between father and son, but there's a nagging feeling that something doesn't fit, or that the whole truth is not out being told. The mystery keeps the story going, until the explosive revelations in the last section of the film.The same elements that made the original successful are back, with everyone still displaying affection for each other in their own peculiar way. Rocket is rough at the edges but can't hide his soft side. There's plenty of cuteness in Baby Groot, and Saldana and Pratt are still working out the ""unspoken"" aspects of their relationship.One should enjoy the visuals for most of the film, and the story unfolding with the best coupling of pop music and a story line since ""Mamma Mia"". There's a sense of nostalgia that wasn't present in the first film, and using some obscure pieces makes their success even more interesting.The bottom line is this works well, and we're looking forward to Groot's next growing phase.","[['Galaxy', 'a welcome surprise', 'a great portrayal', 'friendship'], [], ['the end', 'plenty', 'action', 'sort', 'sense.The', 'gang', 'the center', 'mess', 'Rocket'], ['Retaliation', 'a gang', 'pursue', 'gang', 'the arrival', 'Peter', 'father'], ['a series', 'father', 'son', 'a nagging feeling', 'something', 'the whole truth'], ['The mystery', 'the story', 'the last section', 'everyone', 'affection', 'own peculiar way'], ['Rocket', 'soft side'], ['plenty', 'cuteness', 'Baby Groot', 'Saldana', 'Pratt', 'relationship.One', 'the film', 'the story', 'coupling', 'pop', 'music', 'a story', 'line', 'Mamma Mia'], ['a sense', 'nostalgia', 'the first film', 'success', 'interesting.The bottom line', 'Groot', 'next growing', 'phase']]","[['Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'welcome surprise', 'characters', 'funny lines', 'portrayal of friendship', 'unexpected places'], ['Times', 'relationships', 'cases'], ['end', 'plenty of action', 'stories', 'sort', 'sense.The gang', 'center of mess', 'Rocket', 'valuable items', 'employers'], ['Retaliation', 'gang of thugs', 'pursue', 'gang', 'things', 'arrival of Peter', 'father'], ['results', 'series', 'moments between father', 'son', 'feeling that something', 'whole truth'], ['mystery', 'story', 'explosive revelations', 'last section', 'film.The same elements', 'everyone', 'affection', 'own peculiar way'], ['Rocket', 'edges', 'soft side'], ['plenty of cuteness', 'Baby Groot', 'Saldana and Pratt', 'aspects', 'relationship.One', 'visuals', 'film', 'story', 'coupling of pop music', 'story line', 'Mamma Mia'], ['sense of nostalgia', 'first film', 'obscure pieces', 'success', 'interesting.The bottom line', 'Groot', 'growing phase']]"

29,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,The Sequel to Those Unusual Marvel Superhero in the Galaxy,"This movie was a very fun superhero film. It did not provide us with very heavy storyline, the premise was quite simple and best of it all, it was having lots and lots of funny moments. My wife and I truly enjoyed this movie as we had laughs all over the movie and there were even some emotional moments as well which was very lovely to see at the end (and made my wife very emotional). I love the chemistry among the Guardians, and I loved Baby Groot's very cute and adorable behavior. I also loved the opening scene which I think was very cool.In addition to the good chemistry among the stars, I also felt that Mantis' character was fun to see, especially whenever she was interacting with Drax. In this sequel, it was also surprising to see Drax' very funny characterization and his comments. Both Yondu and Nebula also had larger important role in this movie compared to Volume 1. There was even a surprise new character played by Sylvester Stallone whom I understand would be having larger role in future Marvel movies.Apart from those fun interactions and the nice light story, the movie itself was not the type of full of action scenes. Mostly it was done in the early stage, middle part and the ending part. The sound effects were good, the effects involving Baby Groot and Rocket were awesome, but I felt the CGI effects were not that nice, especially during the scenes in the Ego planet where it really looked computerized. However, it was not really a bothering scene. One thing that was quite curious for me is the trailer to this movie was already showing Kurt Russel portraying Peter's father, which I thought would be best kept hidden to avoid spoiler. But then as we continued watching it, I realized that it was more like a part that was supposed to intrigue us.I personally felt that this movie was better than Volume 1, in term of the story and characterizations. And for those of you who knew that Marvel's movies would have some end credit scenes, better wait till the very end, since this film had got not 1, not 2 not even 3, but 5 post credit scenes altogether.So if you enjoyed the first volume, you would enjoy this one even better. I would recommend you to watch the first one before seeing this one to have a better understanding on the movie. Though I am pretty sure that most likely you would have seen it. Now if you are a fan of a much heavier superhero movie, than this one may not suit your thirst, but I am confident that you would still be entertained watching this one.","[['This movie', 'fun superhero', 'film'], ['heavy storyline', 'the premise'], ['wife', 'this movie', 'the movie', 'the end', 'wife'], ['the chemistry', 'Baby Groot', 'adorable behavior'], ['the opening', 'scene', 'cool.In addition', 'the good chemistry', 'Mantis', 'character', 'Drax'], ['this sequel', 'Drax', 'funny characterization'], ['Yondu', 'Nebula', 'important role', 'this movie', 'Volume'], ['a surprise', 'new character', 'Sylvester Stallone', 'role', 'Marvel', 'movies.Apart', 'the nice light story', 'the movie', 'the type', 'action'], ['the early stage', 'middle part', 'part'], ['The sound', 'Baby Groot', 'Rocket', 'CGI', 'Ego', 'planet'], ['a bothering scene'], ['thing', 'the trailer', 'this movie', 'Kurt Russel', 'Peter', 'father', 'kept hidden', 'spoiler'], ['a part', 'this movie', 'Volume', 'term', 'the story'], ['Marvel', 'some end', 'credit', 'wait', 'end', 'this film', 'post', 'credit', 'the first volume'], ['understanding', 'the movie'], [], ['a fan', 'superhero movie', 'this one', 'thirst']]","[['movie', 'superhero film'], ['heavy storyline', 'premise', 'lots and lots', 'funny moments'], ['wife', 'movie', 'movie', 'emotional moments', 'end', 'wife'], ['chemistry', 'Guardians', 'Baby Groot', 'adorable behavior'], ['opening scene', 'cool.In addition', 'good chemistry', 'stars', 'Mantis', 'character', 'Drax'], ['sequel', 'Drax', 'funny characterization', 'comments'], ['Yondu and Nebula', 'important role', 'movie', 'Volume'], ['surprise', 'new character', 'Sylvester Stallone', 'role', 'Marvel movies.Apart', 'fun interactions', 'nice light story', 'movie', 'type', 'action scenes'], ['early stage', 'middle part', 'part'], ['sound effects', 'effects', 'Baby Groot', 'Rocket', 'CGI effects', 'scenes', 'Ego planet'], ['bothering scene'], ['thing', 'trailer', 'movie', 'Kurt Russel', 'Peter', 'father', 'kept hidden', 'spoiler'], ['part', 'movie', 'Volume', 'term', 'story and characterizations'], ['Marvel', 'movies', 'end credit scenes', 'wait', 'end', 'film', 'post credit scenes', 'first volume'], ['understanding', 'movie'], [], ['fan', 'superhero movie', 'one', 'thirst']]"

36,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Must disengage brain entirely to enjoy,"With so much talent in this film, it's so disappointing that the writers were right . Don't waste a dime on developing a sensible plot because the hordes of fans will eat this crap up like it was a 5 star meal. Hence the 8.1 star rating which reflects a demographic with time on their hands and a studio with plenty of marketing budget.On the bright side - the CGI is great. The sets are beautiful. There are some very funny moments. The cast still has some chemistry with each other. And I've seen movies that were much worse and unwatchable than this one. But I wouldn't be honest if I didn't give this a very generous 5 because of the horrendous, deficient plot. And after this film I'd have to say that I've about had enough with this series. We've heard the story, had some fun with the characters and it's clear that what was fun, fresh and original is what it should have been - a one film wonder leaving Hollywood to develop another story. Without giving away the big reveal or true spoilers, I'll explain the problem that are evident throughout the entire film:(1) Repeated jokes as if we're supposed to be warmed to it, e.g. how dumb and oblivious baby Groot is (except when he needs not to be.) Funny at the opening moment and gets more difficult to stomach as we make our way through.(2) The fact that our heroes are never really in danger. They are always somehow able to avoid dangers of the most extreme kind for prolonged periods while they joke during the encounter and then you know they will be saved by some unknown force to be named shortly.(3) The abject stupidity of supremely smart characters. Because we need those whose level of intelligence is off the charts to continue to do some really stupid or missing the obvious for a prolonged period of time but just enough for our heroes to have the time to do something to save themselves and the galaxy from certain destruction.(4) The explanation of the villain's plan made absolutely no sense. It was the usual pseudo-brilliant but amorphous hogwash that only made sense when you were 5 years old in the world of make believe without having to think about whether there was any logic.(5) Occasional product placement. Fedex anyone? It's one thing to have a ""special moment"" and another to believe we're too stupid to understand why it happened. And then there is Baby Groot who exists and will continue to exist solely for merchandising... Too cute to kill off. ;)","[['much talent', 'this film'], ['a dime', 'a sensible plot', 'this crap', 'star', 'meal'], ['Hence', 'star', 'rating', 'time', 'a studio', 'plenty', 'the bright side', 'CGI'], [], [], ['The cast', 'some chemistry'], [], ['deficient plot'], ['this film', 'this series'], ['the story', 'some fun', 'fun', 'film', 'wonder', 'Hollywood', 'another story'], ['the big reveal', 'the problem', 'the entire film'], ['oblivious baby', 'Groot'], ['Funny', 'the opening', 'moment', 'way'], ['The fact', 'danger'], ['extreme kind', 'the encounter', 'some unknown force'], ['The abject stupidity'], ['level', 'intelligence', 'a prolonged period', 'time', 'the time', 'something', 'the galaxy', 'certain destruction'], ['The explanation', 'the villain', 'plan', 'no sense'], ['amorphous hogwash', 'sense', 'the world', 'make', 'any logic'], ['Occasional', 'product', 'placement'], ['Fedex', 'anyone'], ['thing', 'special moment'], ['Baby Groot', 'Too'], []]","[['much talent', 'film', 'writers'], ['dime', 'sensible plot', 'hordes of fans', 'crap', 'star meal'], ['Hence', 'star rating', 'time', 'hands', 'studio with plenty', 'bright side', 'CGI'], ['sets'], ['funny moments'], ['cast', 'chemistry'], ['movies'], ['deficient plot'], ['film', 'series'], ['story', 'fun', 'characters', 'fun', 'film wonder', 'Hollywood', 'story'], ['big reveal', 'true spoilers', 'problem', 'entire film', 'jokes'], ['baby Groot'], ['Funny', 'opening moment', 'way'], ['fact', 'heroes', 'danger'], ['dangers', 'extreme kind', 'prolonged periods', 'encounter', 'unknown force'], ['abject stupidity', 'smart characters'], ['level of intelligence', 'charts', 'period of time', 'heroes', 'time', 'something', 'galaxy', 'certain destruction'], ['explanation', 'villain', 'plan', 'sense'], ['amorphous hogwash', 'sense', 'years', 'world of make', 'logic'], ['Occasional product placement'], ['Fedex anyone'], ['thing', 'special moment'], ['Baby Groot', 'Too'], []]"

That's the basic storyline here & it's well done with some new faces on screen like two absolute legends of Cinema, Kurt Russell as Ego & Sylvester Stallone as an old ravenger who used to work with Yondu, named Stakar Ogord. Great having these two legends enter this MCU as i grew up watching & loving these guys & they starred together as partners in the Classic Action Cop Thriller ""Tango & Cash"" from way back in the 80's. Also there's much more emotional depth to all the characters this time & makes us care for this time & like them even more. Yondu (Played greatly again by Michael Rooker) has so much more depth to his rugged, angry & deadly Ravenger here that we get to understand him & find out what he's done for Peter Quill. Baby Groot is absolutely adorable & so cute that he steals the show & Peter Quill aka: Starlord gets much more emotional depth with his past catching up to him with a few surprises. All the characters get lots of time to shine here & even Rocket opens up more too!!!
The special effects are as always Amazing & the comedy is just right with plenty of fun comments & banter between our group & that's why is such a fun movie as we love to hang out with this group of misfits & the love of this team is on full display by the end.
A blast of thrilling adventure, stunning set pieces, witty humour, beautiful colourful cinematography, good music & lots of Action make this one great big budget blockbuster popcorn extravaganza. Fun for the whole family, we all loved it.","[['Vol.2', 'spectacular fun'], ['This sequel', 'a blast', 'intergalactic fun', 'this time', 'a whole lot', 'Heart'], ['Guardian', 'Galaxy', 'this time', 'a new strange planet', 'a God-like man', 'EGO', 'Peter Quills', 'a big sinister', 'plot', 'Galaxy'], ['the basic storyline', 'screen', 'Cinema', 'Kurt Russell', 'Ego', 'Sylvester Stallone', 'an old ravenger', 'Yondu', 'Stakar Ogord'], ['Great', 'MCU', 'i', 'Action Cop Thriller', 'Tango', 'Cash', 'way'], ['emotional depth', 'this time', 'this time'], ['Yondu', 'Played', 'Michael Rooker', 'depth', 'rugged', 'Ravenger', 'Peter Quill'], ['Baby Groot', 'the show', 'Peter Quill', 'Starlord', 'emotional depth', 'past'], ['time', 'Rocket'], ['Amazing', 'the comedy', 'plenty', 'fun', 'banter', 'group', 'a fun movie', 'this group', 'the love', 'this team', 'full display', 'the end'], ['A blast', 'adventure', 'set', 'humour', 'beautiful colourful cinematography', 'good music', 'Action', 'great big budget', 'blockbuster', 'popcorn', 'extravaganza'], ['Fun', 'the whole family']]","[['Vol.2', 'spectacular fun'], ['sequel', 'blast', 'intergalactic fun', 'time', 'whole lot', 'Heart'], ['Guardian', 'Galaxy', 'time', 'new strange planet', 'God-like man', 'EGO', 'Peter Quills', 'things', 'sinister plot', 'heroes', 'Galaxy'], ['basic storyline', 'screen', 'legends of Cinema', 'Kurt Russell', 'Ego', 'Sylvester Stallone', 'old ravenger', 'Yondu', 'Stakar Ogord'], ['Great', 'legends', 'MCU as i', 'guys', 'partners', 'Action Cop Thriller', 'Tango & Cash', 'way'], ['emotional depth', 'characters', 'time', 'time'], ['Yondu', 'Played', 'Michael Rooker', 'depth', 'rugged', 'deadly Ravenger', 'Peter Quill'], ['Baby Groot', 'show', 'Peter Quill', 'Starlord', 'emotional depth', 'past', 'few surprises'], ['characters', 'lots of time', 'Rocket'], ['special effects', 'Amazing', 'comedy', 'plenty of fun comments', 'banter', 'group', 'fun movie', 'group of misfits', 'love', 'team', 'full display', 'end'], ['blast', 'adventure', 'set pieces', 'humour', 'beautiful colourful cinematography', 'good music', 'lots of Action', 'budget blockbuster popcorn extravaganza'], ['Fun', 'whole family']]"
39,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,The One There By Your Side,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" is less smart ass than the original and all heart. ""Guardians 2"" is all about family. ""Vol. 2"" is the movie rarity—the sequel greater than the original. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" retains its whimsical irreverence and funnier than thou swag with stunning visuals. From the opening sequence the Guardians hilariously thrash and get thrashed by a galactic serpent on some distant planet. Their mission is to recover some invaluable unpronounceable energy batteries for the elitist Sovereign race. Director and Writer James Gunn establishes the veiled narrative thread, and the movie is warp speed ahead.Incredible action and wisecracks aside what creates ""Guardians 2"" as special is family. I was moved and inspired as Chris Pratt's Peter confesses, ""Sometimes, the thing you've been looking for your whole life is right there beside you all along."" From the first ""Guardians"" we recall the deadly rivalry of the sisters Gamora, played by strong nurturing Zoe Saldana, and Nebula, played by suffering and poignant Karen Gillan. After fighting nearly to the death, Nebula cries to her sister, ""You're the one who wanted to win! I wanted a sister!"" Saldana and Gillan are amazing. ""Guardians 2"" fiercely dares to touch your heart.Chris Pratt impressively chiseled his body to play Peter Quill. He admirably helms the action star mantle. He makes ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" greater as a whole. He does charming smart ass whether he is clumsily romancing beautiful Saldana's Gamora or delivering throwaway on-liners. Pratt's humanity distinguishes him as a true star. Peter discovers his father Ego, played by charismatic Kurt Russell. Ego is the Celestial-- literally a god, who left Peter's dying Mother. Peter asks his Father if she was the love of his life, why he left her. Peter says, ""I had to watch her die!"" Michael Rooker's Ravager thief Yondu was the one who raised Peter in Ego's absence. All is not what it seems. Rooker's nobility and compassion resonates the profound conflict of Peter's Fathers. Ego tells Peter that he loves him, having finally found him after all these years. He wants to share his legacy and power with his son. James Gunn brilliantly orchestrates the interstellar action, wisecracks, and tragedy. He fearlessly evokes his version of Shakespeare in this comic book tale. ""Guardians 2"" is wildly entertaining with the great soul. Hysterical mercenary Rocket, the cybernetic raccoon voiced by sarcastic Bradley Cooper, steals some of the Sovereign batteries as lovely parting gifts from the arrogant golden skinned jerks. Humorless Queen Ayesha, played by wonderfully zealous Elizabeth Debicki, sends her 'gamer' operated space fleet upon the Guardians in retaliation. Fortunately, Ego and his companion Mantis, played by whimsical beauty Pom Klementieff, save our heroes from destruction. Ego tells Peter that he is his father. Peter, Gamora, and Drax, played by brutishly funny Dave Bautista, agree to accompany his Father to his home planet Ego—the planet he created. The visual images of Ego are idyllic and serene. Russell's Ego is both omnipotent and the great enigma. Mantis is the gifted empath, who helps him sleep and protects his secrets. Ego welcomes his son home, revealing his destiny. Ego doesn't necessarily add up. Is this what Peter wished for?Director Gunn's ""Guardians 2"" invents the narrative spectrum of David Hasselhoff jokes, cool retro '70s rock, kick ass martial arts, galactic ship battles, and quirky charming relationships. With Gunn's direction all his stars give their best. Bautista's hulking tatted blue warrior Drax is crude, brave, and soulful. Klementieff's Mantis is mesmerizing charm. She is genuinely kind, crushing on Big Drax. Saldana is awesome. She has a commanding and calming screen presence. Gunn could have leveraged more romance in Gamora and Peter's love story. Throughout Pratt and Saldana generate authentic chemistry. The narrative focus is on Peter's bond with his fathers, and Gamora's reconcile with estranged sister Nebula. Saldana is radiant and noble with Gillan's surprising Nebula. Gillan's humanity emerges as we empathize for her desire to be loved. I think ""Guardians 2"" becomes the story of the Fathers and their son —of love and destiny. All is not what it appears. Russell and Rooker are eloquently polarizing forces. Pratt embodies courage and fearless vulnerability as Peter boldly defines the man he wants to be. ""Guardians 2"" is touchingly, tearfully about unconditional love and choice. Considering the grand design of the movie that is the wondrous surprise. Simple and sweet. I loved ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2"".","[['Galaxy Vol'], ['smart ass', 'all heart'], ['family'], ['Vol'], ['the movie', 'rarity—the', 'sequel'], ['Galaxy Vol'], ['whimsical irreverence', 'thou',

40,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,A pleasant film to watch; if a drop from the original,"Another enjoyable entry, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' is very good fun.I actually didn't find the story in this as interesting as in the first film, but the humour - which is still up to the mark in 'Guardians of the Galaxy' - is much greater here; it got more laughs from me, that's for sure. The ending to this is also entertaining.Chris Pratt and Co. are just as enjoyable as before, with Dave Bautista particularly standing out to me here; if only due to his amusing moments. I like the addition of Pom Klementieff, I can see a spot for her in the crew. Kurt Russell and Elizabeth Debicki make for contrasting newcomers, Russell is just about good but I felt Debicki and her lot were underused/unintriguing.Not the most compelling plot, which I found more predictable than what the MCU usually produces, but the strong action end and noteworthy humour elevates it to become a pleasant film to watch; if a drop from the original.","[['Another enjoyable entry', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['good fun.I', 'the story', 'the first film', 'the humour', 'the mark', 'Galaxy'], ['Pratt', 'Co.', 'Dave Bautista'], ['the addition', 'Pom Klementieff', 'a spot', 'the crew'], ['Kurt Russell', 'Elizabeth Debicki', 'Russell', 'Debicki', 'lot', 'compelling plot', 'MCU', 'the strong action', 'end', 'noteworthy humour', 'a pleasant film', 'a drop']]","[['enjoyable entry', ""'Guardians"", 'Galaxy Vol'], ['good fun.I', 'story', 'first film', 'humour', ""mark in 'Guardians"", 'Galaxy', 'laughs'], ['entertaining.Chris Pratt and Co.', 'Dave Bautista', 'moments'], ['addition of Pom Klementieff', 'spot', 'crew'], ['Kurt Russell', 'Elizabeth Debicki', 'newcomers', 'Russell', 'Debicki', 'lot', 'compelling plot', 'MCU', 'action end', 'noteworthy humour', 'pleasant film', 'drop']]"
41,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"Subverts expectations, but half of the movie is a slog","I along with many other people loved the first Guardians when it came out. No one knew what it was, though I had some minor knowledge of them from the comics. It was a hit so obviously Marvel was gonna do more.The way this movie starts off is something James Gunn did as he probably wanted to subvert the expectations of what people thought would happen. Everyone though after the initial scene that they would fly off and find an adventure together and have a fun romp like the first one with the crew getting along and having a blast of an adventure.Instead after the opening bit, he pretty much reduces their relationships to rubble as well as Star-Lord's iconic ship. I don't mind Gunn doing something that we didn't expect, but its after this point that the movie splits into two stories as the Guardians split into two groups.Peter, Drax, and Gamorra go to Peter's father's planet. The 2nd group starts with Groot, Rocket, and Nebula, and but then adds on Yondu and the mutinous crew of Ravagers. The Rocket/Yondu/Groot story felt fun and like an adventure that we would see the Guardians take part of. The Star-Lord/Father bit is one of the slowest, uninteresting thing you could ever watch in an ""adventure"" movie.That whole side of the story is just exposition after exposition and you 100% know his father is going to turn out evil, no question. So since there is no question or doubt he will be bad, you spend all of those times they cut back to it just waiting and waiting for the turn to happen and it is so dull. They also take quite a while introducing and getting us used to Mantis, which is fine, but the pace at which they do that along with the Peter/Father stuff just brings the whole movie down.There's way too many repeated jokes that are just annoying (ie ""It's Not Ripe yet"", ""Tazerface"", the many times Rocket is made fun of, and some really unneeded sexual humor).I just wish they had tackled the Star Lord's father part of the script differently. It just brings down the movie so much whenever they cut back to it. Also the Yondu/Peter father/son relationship felt way too forced. Since they don't see each other until the end there is no buildup to them ever having that kind of relationship. Even in the first movie it's never alluded to that Yondu raised Peter like a son.It's a shame as the opening is fantastic, there are small bits here and there that are really good, and the final action scene is great. It's just the Star Lord/father stuff that really wasn't done well and the overused jokes just really become annoying. I'd watch a Yondu/Rocket/Groot full on movie over what they split this movie into.","[[], ['some minor knowledge'], ['a hit', 'Marvel', 'way', 'this movie', 'something', 'James Gunn'], ['Everyone', 'the initial scene', 'an adventure', 'a fun', 'romp', 'the first one', 'the crew', 'a blast', 'an adventure.Instead', 'the opening', 'bit', 'Star-Lord', 'iconic ship'], ['Gunn', 'something', 'this point', 'the movie', 'groups.Peter', 'Drax', 'Gamorra', 'Peter', 'father', 'planet'], ['group', 'Groot', 'Rocket', 'Nebula', 'Yondu', 'the mutinous crew', 'Ravagers'], ['Rocket/Yondu/Groot', 'story', 'fun', 'an adventure', 'part'], ['Star-Lord/Father', 'bit', 'thing', 'adventure', 'whole side', 'the story', 'exposition', 'exposition', '%', 'father', 'no question'], ['no question', 'doubt', 'the turn'], ['a while', 'introducing', 'Mantis', 'the pace', 'Peter/Father', 'stuff', 'the whole movie', 'way', 'Ripe', 'Tazerface', 'Rocket', 'fun', 'unneeded sexual humor', '.I', 'Star Lord', 'father part', 'the script'], ['the movie'], ['Yondu/Peter', 'father/son', 'relationship', 'way'], ['the end', 'no buildup', 'kind', 'relationship'], ['the first movie', 'Yondu', 'Peter', 'a son.It', 'a shame', 'the opening', 'the final action', 'scene'], ['Star Lord/father', 'stuff', 'become annoying'], ['Yondu/Rocket/Groot', 'movie', 'this movie']]","[['many other people', 'first Guardians'], ['minor knowledge', 'comics'], ['hit', 'Marvel', 'way', 'movie', 'something James Gunn', 'expectations', 'people'], ['Everyone', 'initial scene', 'adventure', 'fun romp', 'first one', 'crew', 'blast', 'adventure.Instead', 'opening bit', 'much reduces', 'relationships', 'Star-Lord', 'iconic ship'], ['Gunn', 'something', 'point', 'movie', 'stories', 'Guardians', 'groups.Peter', 'Drax', 'Gamorra', 'Peter', 'father', 'planet'], ['group', 'Groot', 'Rocket', 'Nebula', 'Yondu', 'crew of Ravagers'], ['Rocket/Yondu/Groot story', 'fun', 'adventure', 'Guardians', 'part'], ['Star-Lord/Father bit', 'thing', 'adventure', 'whole side', 'story', 'exposition after exposition', '%', 'father', 'question'], ['question or doubt', 'times', 'turn'], ['while introducing', 'Mantis', 'pace', 'Peter/Father stuff', 'whole movie', 'way', 'jokes', 'Ripe', 'Tazerface', 'times Rocket', 'fun', 'unneeded sexual humor', '.I', 'Star Lord', 'father part', 'script'], ['movie'], ['Yondu/Peter father/son relationship', 'way'], ['end', 'buildup', 'kind of relationship'], ['first movie', 'Yondu', 'Peter', 'son.It', 'shame', 'opening', 'small bits', 'action scene'], ['Star Lord/father stuff', 'overused jokes', 'become annoying'], ['Yondu/Rocket/Groot', 'movie', 'movie']]"
42,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Easily the Most Underrated Movie of Phase Three,"I do not understand why this movie isn't talked about more.

Anyways, this movie is also the absolute funniest movie in the MCU, no competition. And the cast are arguably just as good as they were in the first movie.

44,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"The script is full of humor, which guides all the action. And the jokes work and fit very well in each moment and the technical part delivers a lot of fun to the audience","After Marvel's risky foray with relatively unknown characters and which were at odds with the tone of the films presented so far in its universe, Marvel managed to make ""Guardians of the Galaxy a world pop phenomenon by conquering a resounding box office around the world. , and continuing its shared universe, Marvel Studios again commissioned James Gunn to script and direct this new adventure, with the difficult mission of further expanding this vast Cosmic Universe, and he did it with praise. previous film returned for this sequence, which manages to be bigger and better in several aspects.The film begins with Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), leader of the Sovereign race, hiring the Guardians to protect valuable batteries from an inter-dimensional monster in exchange for Gamora's sister (Zoe Saldana), Nebula (Karen Gillan), who was caught trying steal them. After Rocky (Bradley Cooper's voice) steals some batteries, the Sovereigns attack the Guardians' ship with a fleet of drones. These drones are destroyed by a mysterious figure, but the Guardians are forced to fall on a nearby planet. The figure reveals itself as Quill's father, Ego (Kurt Russell).From there, several side events start to unfold and James Gunn, no longer needing to introduce the heroes, now takes the opportunity to strengthen the relationships between the characters. We can follow Peter's relationship with his previously unknown father, Ego. It is interesting how the relationship between them is built, starting in a way and then gaining new contours as new revelations happen. At the same time there is Peter's passion for Gamora (who is still reluctant to admit his feelings).It also explores the relationship of hurt from the past, but also of love between the sisters Gamora and Nebula and even the unlikely approach of Rocky and Yondu and the humorous scenes in the relationship between Drax and the new addition to the cast, Mantis (Poe Klementieff ). Not to mention the relationship of love and care that everyone has with Baby Groot (voice of Vin Diesel), which is nothing more than the baby of the family. We can also not fail to quote Michael Rooker, when we find out a little more about his past, about the reasons that led him not to hand over Peter to his father, the actor helps to fill his eyes with tears until they can no longer hold back. From hateful, Yondu Udonta becomes that guy you really wanted to give a tight hug to.James Gunn is not concerned with making connections with other Marvel Phase 3 films. He manages to make a film that competently develops his own universe. The visual effects are still incredible. Even though the film is mostly shot in chroma-key, we don't get the feeling of something out of place. On the contrary, the ships and planets visited are different from those seen previously and add even greater complexity to this infinite universe. The planet of the Sovereign race and the planet of Ego are the exponents that reflect this care in the creation of these planets.Following the same recipe from the previous film, we cannot fail to mention one of the most striking characters in the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" films, his soundtrack, which once again features classics from the 70s, with dancing hymns like Brandy (You 're a Fine Girl), Come A Little Bit Closer and Bring It On Home to Me.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" matches and even surpasses the first in all aspects. The script is full of humor, which guides all the action. And the jokes work and fit very well in each moment and the technical part stands out and delivers a lot of fun to the viewer. It takes over two hours to fly and leaves us with the feeling that there could be much more.","[['Marvel', 'risky foray', 'the tone', 'universe', 'Marvel', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'a world', 'pop', 'phenomenon', 'a resounding', 'box', 'office', 'the world'], ['shared universe', 'Marvel Studios', 'James Gunn', 'this new adventure', 'the difficult mission', 'Cosmic Universe', 'praise'], ['previous film', 'this sequence', 'several aspects.The', 'film', 'Ayesha', 'Elizabeth Debicki', 'leader', 'Sovereign', 'race', 'an inter-dimensional monster', 'exchange', 'Gamora', 'sister', 'Zoe Saldana', 'Nebula', 'Karen Gillan'], ['Rocky', 'Bradley Cooper', 'voice', 'Sovereigns', 'attack', 'ship', 'a fleet'], ['a mysterious figure', 'a nearby planet'], ['The figure', 'Quill', 'father', 'Ego', 'Kurt Russell', 'several side', 'James Gunn', 'the opportunity'], ['Peter', 'relationship', 'unknown father', 'Ego'], ['the relationship', 'a way'], ['the same time', 'Peter', 'passion', 'Gamora', 'the relationship', 'hurt', 'love', 'Gamora', 'Nebula', 'the unlikely approach', 'Rocky', 'Yondu', 'the relationship', 'Drax', 'the new addition', 'the cast', 'Mantis', 'Poe Klementieff'], ['the relationship', 'love', 'care', 'everyone', 'Baby Groot', 'voice', 'Vin Diesel', 'nothing', 'the baby', 'the family'], ['Michael Rooker', 'past', 'hand', 'Peter', 'father', 'the actor'], ['Yondu Udonta', 'guy', 'a tight hug', 'Gunn', 'Marvel Phase'], ['a film', 'own universe'], [], ['the film', 'the feeling', 'something', 'place'], ['complexity', 'this infinite universe'], ['The planet', 'Sovereign', 'race', 'the planet', 'Ego', 'this care', 'the creation', 'the same recipe', 'the previous film', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'soundtrack', 'Brandy', 'Fine Girl', 'Come A Little Bit Closer', 'Bring', 'Home', 'Me'], ['Galaxy Vol'], [], ['The script', 'humor', 'the action'], ['work', 'each moment', 'the technical part', 'a lot', 'fun', 'the viewer'], ['the feeling']]","[['Marvel', 'risky foray', 'unknown characters', 'odds', 'tone', 'films', 'universe', 'Marvel', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'world pop phenomenon', 'resounding box office', 'world'], ['shared universe', 'Marvel Studios', 'James Gunn', 'new adventure', 'difficult mission', 'Cosmic Universe', 'praise'], ['previous film', 'sequence', 'aspects.The film', 'Ayesha', 'Elizabeth Debicki', 'leader', 'Sovereign race', 'Guardians', 'valuable batteries', 'monster in exchange', 'Gamora', 'sister', 'Zoe Saldana', 'Nebula', 'Karen Gillan'], ['Rocky', 'Bradley Cooper', 'voice', 'batteries', 'Sovereigns attack', 'Guardians', 'ship', 'fleet of drones'], ['drones', 'mysterious figure', 'Guardians', 'nearby planet'], ['figure', 'Quill', 'father', 'Ego', 'Kurt Russell', 'side events', 'James Gunn', 'heroes', 'opportunity', 'relationships', 'characters'], ['Peter', 'relationship', 'unknown father', 'Ego'], ['relationship', 'way', 'new contours', 'new revelations'], ['same time', 'Peter', 'passion for Gamora', 'feelings', 'relationship of hurt', 'love', 'sisters Gamora', 'Nebula', 'approach of Rocky', 'Yondu', 'humorous scenes', 'relationship between Drax', 'new addition', 'cast', 'Mantis', 'Poe Klementieff'], ['relationship of love', 'care that everyone', 'Baby Groot', 'voice of Vin Diesel', 'nothing', 'baby', 'family'], ['Michael Rooker', 'past', 'reasons', 'hand', 'Peter', 'father', 'actor', 'eyes with tears'], ['Yondu Udonta', 'guy', 'hug to.James Gunn', 'connections', 'Marvel Phase', 'films'], ['film', 'own universe'], ['visual effects'], ['film', 'feeling of something', 'place'], ['ships and planets', 'complexity', 'infinite universe'], ['planet', 'Sovereign race', 'planet of Ego', 'exponents', 'care', 'creation', 'same recipe', 'previous film', 'striking characters', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'films', 'soundtrack', 'features classics', 'hymns like Brandy', 'Fine Girl', 'Come A Little Bit Closer', 'Bring', 'Home', 'Me'], ['Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['matches', 'aspects'], ['script', 'humor', 'action'], ['jokes work', 'moment', 'technical part', 'lot of fun', 'viewer'], ['hours', 'feeling']]"

47,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"Solid sequel, but not as memorable as its predecessor","#MCUrewatch. GotG2 has the same great humor as the first film. Once again the entire cast is in top form but for me the real highlights of this film (apart from a great Baby Groot title sequence) are Drax (the droll manner with which Bautista says his lines is classic) and Yondu (Rooker is terrific as a Han Solo like space pirate). As I said: the humor is great and director Gunn manages to create a visceral and unique film in terms of esthetics. But...there is something wrong with the plot and story here. GotG1 was a straightforward mission like film. Here...there really is no mission. Just our heroes hanging about. The middle act kinda drags on (especially the Ego sequences) and the finale feels a bit like a rehash of the Dr Strange climax (visually that is). And in terms of plot it is sometimes a bit too much on the nose (although Yondu's farewell line is classic). It is a shame the story/plot aren't as good as in the first film, since all the other things are.","[['MCUrewatch'], ['GotG2', 'the same great humor', 'the first film'], ['the entire cast', 'top form', 'this film', 'Baby Groot', 'title', 'sequence', 'Drax', 'the droll', 'manner', 'Bautista', 'Yondu', 'Rooker', 'Han Solo', 'space', 'pirate'], ['the humor', 'director', 'Gunn', 'unique film'], ['something', 'the plot', 'story'], ['GotG1', 'a straightforward mission', 'film'], ['no mission'], [], ['The middle act', 'kinda', 'Ego', 'a bit', 'a rehash', 'Dr Strange', 'climax'], ['plot', 'a bit', 'the nose', 'Yondu', 'farewell', 'line'], ['a shame', 'the story/plot', 'the first film']]","[['MCUrewatch'], ['GotG2', 'same great humor', 'first film'], ['entire cast', 'top form', 'real highlights', 'film', 'Baby Groot title sequence', 'Drax', 'droll manner', 'Bautista', 'lines', 'Yondu', 'Rooker', 'Han Solo', 'space pirate'], ['humor', 'director Gunn', 'film in terms', 'esthetics'], ['something', 'plot and story'], ['GotG1', 'mission like film'], ['mission'], ['heroes'], ['act kinda drags', 'Ego sequences', 'finale feels', 'bit', 'rehash', 'Dr Strange climax'], ['terms of plot', 'bit', 'nose', 'Yondu', 'farewell line'], ['shame', 'story/plot', 'first film', 'other things']]"
48,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Forget the analysis,"This film is arguably the most entertaining and enjoyable Marvel film in the franchise. And Rocket is perhaps the best character in the franchise. No, the film won't win any best picture or actor awards but it's a wonderful ensemble piece. I've seen the film at least 25 times. I know the dialog. No surprises. And at the of every viewing I'm in tears.

49,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Marvel's The Empire Strikes Back.,"***MAJOR Spoilers Ahead Regarding The Film's Story***Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is one of the MCU's most important chapters: the most important since Captain America: Civil War. The galaxy is at a tipping point since the Guardians saved Xandar from Ronan the Accuser, and in THIS chapter Peter Jason 'StarLord' Quill finds out who his father is: 'Ego: The Living Planet'. Just like with The Empire Strikes Back, the themes of family and chaos and darkness affecting the world are very prominent ones playing throughout the film's story.Guardians of the Galaxy is probably Marvel's most insane franchise yet: James Gunn's zaniness is unsurpassed yet he loves taking years-old characters and changing parts of their backstory and chemistry. Peter finds out that Ego the living planet has been 'planting seeds' across the universe both in the form of ACTUAL seeds and impregnating several beings across the universe. Unfortunately, Ego is the villain of the film. He wants to cleanse the universe of everything but himself. And he wants his 'pure' son to be the one to realise his vision once and for all. Only one problem though: Ego killed Peter's mother, by planting a tumour in her head resulting in her death at the start of the first movie. And Peter decides that his own father is a threat to the universe and must stop him. During the final act, StarLord gets the help of Yondu Udonta and Rocket, Drax, Gamora, Groot Mantis and even Nebula to help take him down during the film's ambitious (though overstuffed) finale.I give Gunn extra points for the fantastic send-off he gave Yondu. The Star Trek echoes are obvious but I really liked the emotional nods to The Wrath of Khan.I liked how Guardians Volume 2 took the stagnant 'Marvel villain' formula and decided to freshen it up a bit by making the villain have an already pre-established effect on the world of the film. And Ego is no Ultron here; no, he's one that has direct importance to StarLord being his father and all. But the revelation that Peter was basically a tool to realise his father's plan reflects the baddie's actual impact on this film alone.So, all in all, Guardians Vol. 2 is definitely worth a trip to the cinema.I give Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 10/10.Oh: by the way, The Watcher is in this movie! Could it be that The Fantastic Four is back at Disney already?

51,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,GOG 2 review,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 is a film written and directed by James Gunn. This film is again a part of the very famous MCU franchise. I hadn't seen the trailers, so I didn't actually know what to expect out of the film. I liked the first one a lot. And I ended up liking this one too.Plot: The Guardians run away from the Sovereign after they steal something from them. Meanwhile, Peter gets to know something about his heritage.Story and direction: This film (and the previous part too) basically reminds you of those 1980's buddy cop action films where people just are banded together for one common cause and they also share a love-hate relation with each other. I like many of those kind of films. Because of which I have a special connection with this film too. Within the first few minutes, I was liking the film. The jokes were quite good (This part has some adult jokes too). Then by the time I got towards the climax and the main crux of the story I began to think ""Was actually the Sovereign necessary??"" I thought that it wasn't necessary. It felt very forced. Also, there was a small part where fast and furious was mentioned (please remember the ""family"" part that Drax says). If more focus would have been given on some characters like Rocket or Gamorra, I would have loved the film. Also even though I liked the jokes, I felt that the jokes were a bit on the too much side. The emotional quotient was quite missing. That is what made this film less likable than the first part. But the VFX and sets were quite massive and great. Also some of the stunts were awesome. Also this is I guess the first film in the MCU, where we had some 4 post credit scenes. Keep Up the good job, MCU.Acting: Chris Pratt was again rocking as the Star Lord. I couldn't replace him with any other actor. Zoe Saldana was also bad-ass as Gamorra. Dave Bautista showed another side of his character Drax (the comic side), which although was in quite excess but was enjoyable. Micheal Rooker was also great as Yondu (will quite miss him in the future parts). Pom Klementieff was a great addition to the cast as Mantis. Sylvester Stallone was not necessary for the film. I still didn't understand why he signed for the film. Kurt Russell was great as Ego.Favorite Scene: I guess it would be the very same as the first part. Yondu using his fin to control the arrow. This time the scene ran for quite a long time. And we see Yondu, Rocket and Groot walking down the road. I mean that scene had a different level of awesomeness in it.Verdict: Although not as great as the first installment, this film is still good. It was vibrant and enjoyable for me. Can't wait for their crossover with The Avengers and in GOG 3.I am going to go with an 8/10","[['Galaxy Vol', 'a film', 'James Gunn'], ['This film', 'a part', 'MCU', 'franchise'], ['the film'], ['a lot'], ['too.Plot', 'Sovereign', 'something'], ['Peter', 'something', 'heritage.Story', 'direction', 'This film', 'the previous part', 'buddy cop action', 'common cause', 'share', 'a love-hate relation'], ['those kind'], ['a special connection', 'this film'], ['the film'], ['This part', 'some adult'], ['the time', 'the climax', 'the main crux', 'the story', 'Was', 'Sovereign'], [], [], ['a small part', 'fast', 'family', 'part', 'Drax'], ['focus', 'Rocket', 'Gamorra', 'the film'], ['a bit', 'much side'], ['The emotional quotient'], ['this film', 'the first part'], ['VFX'], [], ['the first film', 'MCU', 'post', 'credit'], ['the good job', 'Chris Pratt', 'Star Lord'], ['any other actor'], ['Zoe Saldana', 'bad-ass', 'Gamorra'], ['Dave Bautista', 'another side', 'character', 'Drax', 'the comic side'], ['Micheal Rooker', 'Yondu', 'the future'], ['Pom Klementieff', 'a great addition', 'the cast', 'Mantis'], ['Sylvester Stallone', 'the film'], ['the film'], ['Kurt Russell', 'Ego.Favorite Scene', 'the first part'], ['Yondu', 'fin', 'the arrow'], ['This time', 'the scene', 'a long time'], ['Rocket', 'Groot', 'the road'], ['scene', 'a different level', 'awesomeness', 'it.Verdict', 'the first installment', 'this film'], [], ['Ca', 'crossover', 'GOG']]","[['Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol', 'film', 'James Gunn'], ['film', 'part', 'MCU franchise'], ['trailers', 'film'], ['lot'], ['too.Plot', 'Guardians', 'Sovereign', 'something'], ['Peter', 'something', 'heritage.Story and direction', 'film', 'previous part', 'action films', 'people', 'common cause', 'share', 'love-hate relation'], ['kind of films'], ['special connection', 'film'], ['first few minutes', 'film'], ['jokes', 'part', 'adult jokes'], ['time', 'towards', 'climax', 'main crux', 'story', 'Was', 'Sovereign'], [], [], ['small part', 'fast', 'family', 'part', 'Drax'], ['focus', 'characters like Rocket', 'Gamorra', 'film'], ['jokes', 'jokes', 'bit', 'much side'], ['emotional quotient'], ['film', 'first part'], ['VFX and sets'], ['stunts'], ['first film', 'MCU', 'post credit scenes'], ['good job', 'Chris Pratt', 'Star Lord'], ['other actor'], ['Zoe Saldana', 'bad-ass as Gamorra'], ['Dave Bautista', 'side', 'character Drax', 'comic side'], ['Micheal Rooker', 'Yondu', 'future parts'], ['Pom Klementieff', 'great addition', 'cast as Mantis'], ['Sylvester Stallone', 'film'], ['film'], ['Kurt Russell', 'Ego.Favorite Scene', 'first part'], ['Yondu', 'fin', 'arrow'], ['time', 'scene', 'long time'], ['Rocket and Groot', 'road'], ['scene', 'level of awesomeness', 'it.Verdict', 'first installment', 'film'], [], ['Ca', 'crossover', 'Avengers', 'GOG']]"
52,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,More of the same,"This review contains spoilers.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is the sequel to Guardians of the Galaxy. It follows the guardians of the galaxy with the same cast as they handle odd jobs on the journey to finding Peter Quill's father and origins. All of the characters from the previous movie are found here with their personalities intact. The story starts with a galactic side story and ends with the guardians of the galaxy discovering Peter Quill's father and his plans to dominate the universe.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2's strengths are in its characters and dialogue. The action has great effects and direction, but the characters and dialogue are the true draw to the movie. For any detractors that did not like any of the original's characters, the sequel will not change your mind. The characters undergo minor character arcs but for the most part, they stay the same. The movie is incredibly funny as the characters have great chemistry. The problems in this movie are its writing in other areas.The movie's story and pacing have problems. The main arc of Peter Quill's father is hinted at the start but not followed up until the second half of the movie. The movie focuses on other stories and resolves some character arcs such as Quill's adoptive father. Ultimately, all the arcs converge onto Ego, Quill's father. The story could have been improved but as it stands, the movie is a tour across the universe without much substance.Overall I would still recommend Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. The movie has its flaws but it is still entertaining.Grade: B.","[['This review', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['the sequel', 'Galaxy'], ['the galaxy', 'the same cast', 'the journey', 'Peter Quill', 'father'], ['the previous movie'], ['The story', 'a galactic side', 'story', 'the galaxy', 'Peter Quill', 'father', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['dialogue'], ['The action', 'direction', 'dialogue', 'the true draw', 'the movie'], ['the sequel', 'mind'], ['minor character', 'arcs', 'part'], ['The movie', 'great chemistry'], ['this movie', 'writing', 'other areas.The movie', 'story'], ['The main arc', 'Peter Quill', 'father', 'the start', 'the second half', 'the movie'], ['The movie', 'some character', 'Quill', 'adoptive father'], ['the arcs converge', 'Ego', 'Quill', 'father'], ['The story', 'the movie', 'the universe', 'much substance.Overall', 'Galaxy Vol'], [], ['The movie', 'B']]","[['review', 'spoilers.Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['sequel', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy'], ['guardians', 'galaxy', 'same cast', 'odd jobs', 'journey', 'Peter Quill', 'father and origins'], ['characters', 'previous movie', 'personalities'], ['story', 'side story', 'guardians', 'galaxy', 'Peter Quill', 'father', 'plans', 'universe.Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['strengths', 'characters and dialogue'], ['action', 'great effects and direction', 'characters and dialogue', 'true draw', 'movie'], ['detractors', 'characters', 'sequel', 'mind'], ['characters', 'character arcs', 'part'], ['movie', 'characters', 'great chemistry'], ['problems', 'movie', 'writing', 'other areas.The movie', 'story', 'problems'], ['arc of Peter Quill', 'father', 'start', 'second half', 'movie'], ['movie', 'other stories', 'character', 'Quill', 'adoptive father'], ['converge onto Ego', 'Quill', 'father'], ['story', 'movie', 'universe', 'much substance.Overall', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol'], [], ['movie', 'flaws', 'B']]"

With a whole multi-verse to continue to explore, Vol. 2 doesn't rest on its laurels or spend a lot of time revisiting old haunts. Instead, the sequel rockets the Guardians to brand new worlds to meet an array of new aliens and gods, most of whom want the Guardians dead for various reasons. Vol. 2 is a hell of a ride once again.

So with planet hoping and times lines of the m c u In the Marvel Cinematic Universe timeline the film takes place in 2014, three months after Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). It takes place a year after Thor: The Dark World (2013), before or after Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), and a year before Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015). Ego arrived on Earth and began his relationship with Meredith Quill in 1980, which took place 38 years after Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) and 32 years before
Stan Lee clearly exists, you know, above and apart from the reality of all the films. So the notion that he could be sitting there on a cosmic pit stop during the jump gate sequence in 'Guardians' was something very fun, it says, 'Wait a minute, he's this same character who's popped up in all these films?'""So with connections to up and coming phase 3 films in this movie
While traveling via multiple space hops, one of the planets the ship travels past appears to be the Kronan homeworld. This is home to Korg the rock creature, who will be appearing in the Planet Hulk storyline of Thor: Ragnarok (2017). Thor already fought and defeated a ""Kronanite"" in Thor: The Dark World (2013).The opening battle sequence resembles the first issue of the 2008 comic book, which featured the newly formed Guardians battling a giant monster from another dimension. In that story the Guardians were defending a cult called the Universal Church of Truth, which had ties to Adam Warlock. In the film the Guardians are working for the Sovereign race, which is later revealed to be in possession of Adam Warlock's cocoon. Both the Sovereign and the Church become adversaries of the Guardians.The Sovereign are an arrogant and xenophobic race of golden beings genetically engineered for perfection. The Sovereign consider themselves superior to every other race in the galaxy
When the Sovereign chase the Guardians, they use a remotely piloted ship. The consoles they are operating look like the ones in video game arcades back in the 80's and 90's, especially when the eliminated pilots crowd around the last remaining starfighter, cheering him on. In another nod, the Guardians fly into a Quantum Asteroid Field to escape them. ""Asteroids"" is a very early arcade console game.
As a result of the Guardians' victory over Ronan in the Battle of Xandar, they are hired by the Sovereign to protect the Anulax Batteries from the Abilisk in exchange for The Sovereign releasing Gamora's sister Nebula (Karen Gillen) into the Guardians' custody. Their golden high priestess Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki) declares war on the Guardians after Rocket (Bradley Cooper) steals some of the Anulax Batteries
When they escaped from the Sovereign fleet, the Guardians of the Galaxy crash landed their starship the Milano on the planet Berhert. On this forest world, the Guardians meet Ego and Mantis (Pom Klementieff), his empathic helper. Soon, the Guardians split up: Star-Lord, Gamora (Zoe Saldana), and Drax (Dave Bautista) accompany Ego and Mantis back to Ego's planet while Rocket remains on Berhert to repair the Nebula
The ice world of Contraxia would seem to be an unusual vacation destination, but nonetheless, Contraxia is a favorite stop for the many factions of the Ravagers. When staying in Contraxia, the Ravagers frequent the Iron Lotus, the planet's most colorful den of sin, drink, gambling, and ill-repute. Howard the Duck, after escaping confinement in the Collector's destroyed museum on Knowhere, was sighted schmoozing at the Iron Lotus
One of the most powerful yet unusual beings in the universe, Ego is a Celestial born countless millions of years ago. Alone in the beginning, Ego, in the form of a giant brain, began expanding itself and gathering knowledge, eventually taking the form of a lush garden planet roughly the size of Earth's moon (but with a human-looking face). Eventually, Ego began creating avatars of himself, taking on the forms of the races that inhabit the planets he visited to spread his seed. This includes taking on a human form and siring Peter Quill with Meredith Quill on Earth.
Ego hired Yondu and the Ravagers to retrieve each of his children born across the alien races, but Peter was the only one of Ego's offspring able to tap into the light, Ego's Celestial powers, which would allow Ego to absorb all of the planets he seeded into himself. Ego has a strange side to him that he does reveal but
When Yondu, Rocket and Groot escaped the Ravagers on board a splinter ship called the Quadrant, their destination was Ego's world to rescue the rest of the Guardians. However, Rocket miscalculated the number of necessary space jumps it would require to reach Ego, and the Quadrant ended up performing 750 space jumps.We saw several unidentified planets and aliens in the course of the Quadrant careening across the multi-verse, but the most significant aliens sighted were the Watchers. The Watchers are an ancient race whose mandate is to observe all events in the universe - but they must never interfere. This particular gathering of Watchers were being regaled by tales of the misadventures of one of their own informants, who had taken the form of an older human male (Stan Lee). Uatu, the Watcher assigned to observe Earth, resides on the Blue Area of Earth's moon. It's possible this was the location briefly glimpsed when the Quadrant jumped in the vicinity of the Watchers.that Nebula ""is a pretty angry woman, with some daddy issues and that, in the second movie, we're going to start to see how much pain her father actually caused her, and we're going to delve right into the relationship with her sister Gamora. I think we might even feel a tinge of sympathy towards her this time.""
There is five end credits this film is madness and you expect nothing else
One of the end credit scenes shows the Sovereign creating a cocoon of sorts for a new being named ""Adam."" It is assumed that this refers to the character Adam Warlock
Uatu is the Watcher assigned to observe Earth 616, the reality in which the regular Marvel Comics Universe takes place.
. Also appearing were Krugarr, an alien sorcerer who, in the comics, was from another timeline and was the disciple of Doctor Strange, and Mainframe, an alien female robot who, in the comics, was a male and an android related to the Vision
Star-Lord's father, as a continuation of exploring the personal side of the Guardians: ""If a raccoon could talk and shoot a machine gun, how could that be? Answering that question ended up being the entire foundation of the first film. There's a sadness in these characters. Rocket was an animal experimented upon and torn apart. Groot has far more in common with Frankenstein's monster than with Bugs Bunny. Ego is an even more ridiculous character. But if a planet was alive, how could that be? And how could it father a child? Nova Prime said about Peter's father in the first film that he is something ancient and unknown, and being a cosmic being, alone for eons, is even more lonely than being the universe's sole talking raccoon.""
This film is nearly as good as the first film the special effects and color would be probably great in 3d like the first I just saw it on DVD and its a bonkers stunning film great acting as usual and groot and rocket steal the show As usual

56,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,One of the very best films so far this year (that's for sure).,"'GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The highly anticipated sequel to the blockbuster 2014 superhero flick 'GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY', based on the Marvel comic book of the same name. The film is once again written and directed by James Gunn, and all of the original's starring cast return as well; including Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan, Sean Gunn, and the voices of Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. They're joined this time around by Kurt Russell, Elizabeth Debicki, Pom Kelmentieff, Chris Sullivan and Sylvester Stallone. The story this time deals with the Guardians helping Peter Quill learn more about his father, who he meets for the first time. The movie has received mostly positive reviews from critics (just like the first) and it's a blockbuster at the Box Office so far as well (just like the first). I loved it.The story begins in 2014, when Peter Quill, also known as Star-Lord (Pratt), and his friends, are now all well known (across the cosmos) as 'The Guardians of the Galaxy'. They're hired by the Sovereign race to protect valuable batteries from a giant space monster. In exchange they're given Gamora's (Saldana) sister Nebula (Gillan); who was trying to steal the batteries for herself. Upon leaving, Rocket (Cooper) also steals some of the batteries, for no apparent reason, and the Sovereign race hunt the Guardians down for it. They crash on a planet close by, after being rescued by Peter's father Ego (Russell). The Guardians then help Quill get to know his dad, for the first time. Things are not all as they seem though.The movie is once again full of colorful characters and visuals. It's also full of witty jokes, decent performances (which are all very well cast once again), exciting action scenes, and an awesome soundtrack (featuring Brandy, by the Looking Glass, which is a karaoke song I've done hundreds of times before). The film, this time around, is not quite as original, creative, action-packed or as hilarious as the original though; it does all of those things well, but just not quite as well as the first film. It is once again filled with great character development though (including a lot of psychology and family drama), and very touching dramatic scenes; this is where this sequel actually outdoes the original (I cried more times in this movie than in it's predecessor). Gunn gives it his all once again, and he definitely delivers (it is a near perfect film). When the original is as classic as it is though, it's almost impossible to top the second time around. I still give the movie 5 stars though, and it is one of the very best films so far this year (that's for sure).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/rLEEz_CHZwo","[['THE GALAXY VOL'], ['Half Stars', 'Out', 'Five', 'anticipated sequel', 'the blockbuster', 'superhero', 'flick', 'THE GALAXY', 'Marvel', 'comic book', 'the same name'], ['The film', 'James Gunn', 'cast return', 'Chris Pratt', 'Zoe Saldana', 'Dave Bautista', 'Michael Rooker', 'Karen Gillan', 'Sean Gunn', 'Bradley Cooper', 'Vin Diesel'], ['this time', 'Kurt Russell', 'Elizabeth Debicki', 'Pom Kelmentieff', 'Chris Sullivan', 'Sylvester Stallone'], ['The story', 'this time', 'Peter Quill', 'father', 'the first time'], ['The movie', 'a blockbuster', 'Box Office'], ['it.The story', 'Peter Quill', 'Star-Lord', 'Pratt', 'the cosmos', 'Galaxy'], ['Sovereign', 'race', 'a giant space', 'monster'], ['exchange', 'Gamora', 'Saldana', 'sister', 'Nebula', 'Gillan', 'herself'], ['Rocket', 'Cooper', 'no apparent reason', 'Sovereign', 'race', 'hunt'], ['a planet', 'close', 'Peter', 'father', 'Ego', 'Russell'], ['Quill', 'dad', 'the first time'], ['though.The movie'], ['action', 'an awesome soundtrack', 'Brandy', 'Looking Glass', 'a karaoke', 'song'], ['The film', 'this time', 'the first film'], ['great character', 'development', 'a lot', 'psychology', 'family', 'drama', 'this sequel', 'this movie', 'predecessor'], ['Gunn', 'a near perfect film'], ['the second time'], ['the movie', 'this year', 'movie', 'review', 'TALK', 'https', '//youtu.be/rLEEz_CHZwo']]","[[""'GUARDIANS"", 'THE GALAXY VOL'], ['Half Stars', 'Out of Five', 'anticipated sequel', 'blockbuster', 'superhero flick', 'THE GALAXY', 'Marvel', 'comic book', 'same name'], ['film', 'James Gunn', 'cast return', 'Chris Pratt', 'Zoe Saldana', 'Dave Bautista', 'Michael Rooker', 'Karen Gillan', 'Sean Gunn', 'voices of Bradley Cooper', 'Vin Diesel'], ['time', 'Kurt Russell', 'Elizabeth Debicki', 'Pom Kelmentieff', 'Chris Sullivan', 'Sylvester Stallone'], ['story', 'time', 'Guardians', 'Peter Quill', 'father', 'first time'], ['movie', 'reviews from critics', 'blockbuster', 'Box Office'], ['it.The story', 'Peter Quill', 'Star-Lord', 'Pratt', 'friends', 'cosmos', ""'The Guardians"", 'Galaxy'], ['Sovereign race', 'valuable batteries', 'space monster'], ['exchange', 'Gamora', 'Saldana', 'sister Nebula', 'Gillan', 'batteries for herself'], ['Rocket', 'Cooper', 'batteries', 'apparent reason', 'Sovereign race hunt', 'Guardians'], ['planet close', 'Peter', 'father Ego', 'Russell'], ['Guardians', 'Quill', 'dad', 'first time'], ['Things', 'though.The movie', 'colorful characters and visuals'], ['witty jokes', 'decent performances', 'action scenes', 'awesome soundtrack', 'Brandy', 'Looking Glass', 'karaoke song', 'hundreds of times'], ['film', 'time', 'things', 'first film'], ['character development', 'lot of psychology', 'family drama', 'touching dramatic scenes', 'sequel', 'times', 'movie', 'predecessor'], ['Gunn', 'near perfect film'], ['second time'], ['movie', 'stars', 'films', 'year', 'movie review', ""'MOVIE TALK"", 'https', '//youtu.be/rLEEz_CHZwo']]"
57,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Brilliant funny,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is just as funny and brilliant as the first one was. I Laughed so many times. But it wasn't only funny at the end it got real sad. James Gunn makes amazing comic book films. He showed that with GOTG Vol 1 + Vol 2 and also with his newest film The Suicide Squad.

58,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Guardians of the galaxy vol.2,"I was lucky enough to see this on 20/4 at an industry screening which allowed me to sit on the film for a few days before I gave a review. I can safely say GotG Volume 2 absolutely wowed me. I can't believe these bunch of lovable misfit a-holes made one of the most MATURE themed films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film is visually gorgeous. The use of colour, design and the straight up imagination of the source material outstand any MCU film prior. The action is glorious and astonishing. One scene in particular, I was jaw-dropped in its entirety as direction, action-choreography and music all came together so harmoniously. And THE MUSIC! What an eargasmic soundtrack. The songs are more poetic this time around and fit the subtext of the film perfectly. The trailers gave me the feel of the first movie; a straight-up Sci-fi action-comedy with a simple point A to B plot. GotGV2 is so much MORE than this! This film is patient with its characters and there is an emphasis on growth and family. It manages to balance 7-8 characters and gives almost all of them a satisfactory emotional arc. There is so much to chew on here with the issues and motifs felt by certain characters and I applaud that! This film is vastly different and I'm glad because I just love these characters so much! They are still so fun and energetic. It's great to see the team again and how their dynamic transforms. Also I forget to mention, the film is laugh-out-loud funny! All thanks to Drax who is by far the most comedic character and put me stitches.Overall, this was both (I can't believe I'm saying this about the Guardians of the Galaxy) an emotionally dense and exciting blast. If Guardians 1 is the fast-paced Sci-Fi adventure like Star Wars was in 1977, then Vol. 2 is the deeper & richer film that takes its time to expand our beloved characters; just like Empire Strikes Back.","[['an industry', 'the film', 'a review'], ['GotG', 'Volume'], ['these bunch', 'lovable misfit', 'MATURE', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe'], ['The film'], ['The use', 'colour', 'design', 'imagination', 'the source', 'material', 'outstand', 'MCU', 'film'], ['The action', 'astonishing'], ['scene', 'entirety', 'direction', 'action-choreography', 'music'], ['MUSIC'], ['an eargasmic soundtrack'], ['this time', 'the subtext', 'the film'], ['the feel', 'the first movie', 'a straight-up Sci-fi action-comedy', 'a simple point', 'B', 'plot'], ['GotGV2'], ['This film', 'an emphasis', 'growth', 'family'], ['a satisfactory emotional arc'], [], ['This film'], [], ['the team'], ['the film', 'laugh-out-loud funny'], ['Drax', 'comedic character', 'Galaxy', 'dense', 'exciting blast'], ['Guardians', 'the fast-paced Sci-Fi adventure', 'Star Wars', 'Vol'], ['film', 'time', 'Empire Strikes Back']]","[['industry', 'film', 'few days', 'review'], ['GotG Volume'], ['bunch', 'misfit a-holes', 'MATURE', 'films', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe'], ['film'], ['use of colour', 'design', 'imagination', 'source material outstand', 'MCU film'], ['action', 'astonishing'], ['scene', 'entirety as direction', 'action-choreography and music'], ['MUSIC'], ['eargasmic soundtrack'], ['songs', 'time', 'subtext', 'film'], ['trailers', 'feel', 'first movie', 'straight-up Sci-fi action-comedy', 'simple point', 'B plot'], ['GotGV2'], ['film', 'characters', 'emphasis on growth', 'family'], ['7-8 characters', 'satisfactory emotional arc'], ['issues and motifs', 'certain characters'], ['film', 'characters'], [], ['team', 'dynamic transforms'], ['film', 'laugh-out-loud funny'], ['thanks', 'Drax', 'comedic character', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'dense', 'exciting blast'], ['Guardians', 'adventure like Star Wars', 'Vol'], ['film', 'time', 'beloved characters', 'Empire Strikes Back']]"

61,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"If Guardians was the film that I left lacking, that was promised to be the the movie for me and then ended up being almost the movie for me;","The superbly names Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 IS the movie made for me. The soundtrack is apt, the jokes are the right kind of nerdy and every character gets their due, they get an arc full of pathos, connection, humour and depth. Absolutely every one of the main characters had me crying out from beneath my 3D glasses throughout. The emotion is rich, relatable and raw and I appreciated it. I mean just the way the movie ends and the interconnectivity of all the plot machinations are warranted and welcome.
The effects, battles, and shooting never felt rushed or cheap. Everything fired on all cylinders with a care and love throughout. The plot was personal and minimal as it should be and the way it was made global was sensible and simple. The stakes couldn't have been higher because they were personal and they didn't need a sky portal to do it.
Even the references I didn't get were welcome little injokes rather than complete set ups for other movies that played in to the tone of the movie. Mantis is excellent and Drax is almost the most hilarious which is saying something. The pacing and the structure of the battles were coherent and made creative use of everyday new skill sets. The film had me in stitches throughout and the potential of Volume 3 and the next iteration of Groot is certainly an appealing one.
The depth effects of the 3D, after he litany of terrible post conversions I've seen, was consistent, pleasurable throughout and extraordinary well done and for one actually enhanced the experience.
This film should be added to the annals of time as the exact right kind of blockbuster sequel that builds upon its predecessors shoulders to create something unique and memorable that was both economical, brisk and yet deep and seemingly never compromised.","[['The superbly', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['the movie'], ['The soundtrack', 'the right kind', 'nerdy', 'every character', 'pathos', 'connection', 'humour', 'depth'], ['beneath'], ['The emotion'], ['the way', 'the movie', 'the interconnectivity', 'the plot'], [], ['Everything', 'a care'], ['The plot', 'the way'], ['a sky portal'], ['complete set', 'the tone', 'the movie'], ['Mantis', 'Drax', 'something'], ['The pacing', 'the structure', 'creative use', 'everyday new skill'], ['The film', 'the potential', 'Volume', 'the next iteration', 'Groot'], ['terrible post', 'the experience'], ['This film', 'time', 'the exact right kind', 'blockbuster', 'sequel', 'something']]","[['superbly names Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['movie'], ['soundtrack', 'jokes', 'kind of nerdy', 'character', 'pathos', 'connection', 'humour and depth'], ['main characters', 'beneath', 'glasses'], ['emotion'], ['way', 'movie', 'interconnectivity', 'plot machinations'], ['effects', 'battles'], ['Everything', 'cylinders', 'care'], ['plot', 'way'], ['stakes', 'sky portal'], ['references', 'welcome little injokes', 'set ups', 'other movies', 'tone', 'movie'], ['Mantis', 'Drax', 'something'], ['pacing', 'structure', 'battles', 'creative use', 'skill sets'], ['film', 'stitches', 'potential of Volume', 'iteration of Groot'], ['depth effects', 'post conversions', 'experience'], ['film', 'annals of time', 'kind of blockbuster sequel', 'predecessors shoulders', 'something']]"
62,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,One of my favorite marvel movies,"Full disclosure: I love the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie, and it wasn't until 3 years after this movie came out that I finally saw it (there are several reasons for that). I'd heard from others that this movie was very good, but not quite as strong as the first one. After seeing this movie finally though, I don't know what they were talking about. This movie was every bit as strong as the first movie, if not stronger in a lot of ways.I won't spoil anything about this film, but I will say that Quill's father is one of the most interesting characters they've had in marvel films, and the fact that he's played by Kurt Russell certainly doesn't hurt.
The story is more interesting and fun than the original, with a lot of very well crafted jokes within the movie. There are some that overstay their welcome just a little bit, but as a whole, they are all great.My favorite aspect of the film was there was no sign of MCU in this movie really at all. There were no random cameos from other marvel superheroes, and there was no ""infinity stones"" or other nonsense like that in this movie. Not saying those things are bad necessarily, but it just feels so nice not having to deal with unnecessary shoehorning in of Marvel things. This was kept relatively tame in the first one as well, but the macguffin in that film was an infinity stone, but this film was it's own separate thing and that made it feel fresh. It didn't even feel like a superhero movie all that much if I'm honest.I don't rate many superhero movies as highly as this, but this one is great. Go watch it if, like me, you put off watching it for fear of not being good.","[['Full disclosure', 'Galaxy', 'movie', 'this movie'], ['this movie', 'the first one'], ['this movie'], ['This movie', 'every bit', 'the first movie', 'a lot', 'ways.I', 'anything', 'this film', 'Quill', 'father', 'marvel', 'the fact', 'Kurt Russell'], ['The story', 'fun', 'a lot', 'the movie'], ['welcome', 'a little bit', 'a whole', 'all great.My favorite aspect', 'the film', 'no sign', 'MCU', 'this movie'], ['no random cameos', 'other marvel', 'infinity', 'other nonsense', 'this movie'], ['Marvel'], ['the first one', 'the macguffin', 'that film', 'an infinity', 'stone', 'this film', 'own separate thing'], ['a superhero movie', 'rate', 'many superhero'], ['Go', 'fear']]","[['Full disclosure', 'first Guardians', 'Galaxy movie', 'years', 'movie', 'several reasons'], ['others', 'movie', 'first one'], ['movie'], ['movie', 'bit', 'first movie', 'lot of ways.I', 'anything', 'film', 'Quill', 'father', 'interesting characters', 'marvel films', 'fact', 'Kurt Russell'], ['story', 'fun', 'lot', 'jokes', 'movie'], ['welcome', 'little bit', 'whole', 'great.My favorite aspect', 'film', 'sign of MCU', 'movie'], ['random cameos', 'marvel superheroes', 'infinity stones', 'other nonsense', 'movie'], ['things', 'feels', 'Marvel things'], ['first one', 'macguffin', 'film', 'infinity stone', 'film', 'own separate thing'], ['superhero movie', 'rate', 'superhero movies'], ['Go', 'fear']]"
63,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Original is the Best but Love This One Too,"It is the characters that we have grown to come and love. And that Peter Quill and his team are back. And how that they end up being the Guardians of the Galaxy officially fighting bad guys.But when Rocket steals something from the people that they were working, named Sovereign for in addition to getting Gamora's estranged wicked Nebula as she has reasons of her own over wanting to get her good sister back.Sovereign wants them to pay but Kurt Russell's Ego character(Yes that is his name), saves them and reveals he is Peter's father. Minus Groot and Rocket who stay behind to fix their wounded ship, the others go with Ego and his right hand woman, Mantis. Who never experienced being included with people except for Ego. Not just showing them his planet. Plus he wants his estranged son to join in on his cause in his own planet.Until the others find something strange on the planet. And try to warn Peter.

65,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Volume 2 brings 2x the fun and action,"Grade: ARating: PG-13, 137 minutesIn a Nutshell: I loved the first Guardians Of The Galaxy and have been sooo excited to see this next one!I wasn't disappointed. James Gunn's Volume 2 sequel is creative, fun, wacky, action-packed, and extremely entertaining. Because it's Volume 2, there are 2 times the action, 2 times the explosions, 2 times the gags and laughs.As Groot says, ""Welcome to the frickin Guardians Of The Galaxy!"" (Although he didn't use the word ""frickin"".)Uplifting theme: ""There are 2 kinds of beings in the universe: those who dance and those who do not."" – Drax (Dave Bautista) ""I wanted more. I desired meaning."" – Ego (Kurt Russell) You need to dance more. Family isn't always just what you are born into. Friendship, sacrifice ""Sometimes the thing that you're searching for your whole life is right there by your side all along and you don't even know it."" - Peter Quill/Star-lord (Chris Pratt) Things I liked: The opening credits alone were awesome and hilarious. That's what I'm talking about! What a way to start the ride. Groot! Oh my gosh, he's soooooo awesome! Chris Pratt sure has come a long way since his flubby days on Parks and Recreation: The Complete Series. Female fans even get to enjoy his new six-pack abs when he takes his shirt off. Kurt Russell! Nice job on the scenes in the opening of the movie when he was younger. Harpulary Batteries. Ha ha We learn so much more about Rocket and his motivations in this one. Sylvester Stallone! The music soundtrack Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Mix Vol. 1 (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) is a lot of fun and plays an important role in the story, like in the first flick. As expected, a lot of slow motion shots. Hilarious. Epic. Talk about a sister feud. Jeez. I love that Marvel always puts Stan Lee in their movies. He actually shows up twice this time in Volume 2. Really great special effects. The talented cast includes Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Michael Rooker, and Kurt Russell. Taserface. Ha ha There was actually a lot of character development and backstory information about our heroes and even some of the villains. It really adds depth to the movie and care even more. In the last movie, Kevin Bacon got some funny shout-outs. This time it's David Hasselhoff. Ha ha Zune. 300 songs. Ha ha Keep watching after the credits start to roll at the end and stay seated until the very, very end. There are quite a few scenes to watch.Things I didn't like: A lot of inappropriate jokes. Some of the lines and scenes in the trailer are different from the actual movie. That always bugs me.To truly appreciate it, you need to have seen the first Guardians Of The Galaxy. The ""gold"" people look cool, but I didn't quite get into what they were all about. As much as I enjoyed it, it's still not as good or fresh as the original. Sequels rarely are, right?Interesting lines: ""All you do is yell at each other. You're not friends."" – Nebula (Karen Gillan) ""You're right. We're family."" – Drax ""When you're ugly and someone loves you, you know they love you for who you are. Beautiful people never know who they can trust."" – Drax Funny lines: ""So, we're really saving the galaxy again?"" – Rocket (Bradley Cooper) ""I guess!"" – Peter Quill/Star-Lord ""Awesome! We're really going to be able to jack up our prices for 2 times galaxy savers!"" – Rocket ""Yes, I prefer to make people the old-fashioned way."" – Peter Quill/Star-Lord ""I'm sorry. I'm using the wrong eye again. That was supposed to be behind your back."" – Rocket after calling the high priestess a douche- bag and then winking. ""Don't call me a raccoon!"" – Rocket ""I'm sorry. I took it too far. Trash Panda."" – Peter Quill/Star-Lord ""Like they say, you're out of luck until you go duck."" – Howard the Duck (He made a surprise and funny appearance at the very end of the first movie.) ""Ha ha. You look like Mary Poppins."" – Peter Quill/Star-Lord ""Is he cool?"" – Yondu (Michael Rooker(Standee advertisement at my local Regal theater)Tips for parents:There is a lot of crude humor. Some profanity. Lots of violence. SPOILER ALERT: You'll laugh out loud and be able to relate to the teenage Groot at the very end.

66,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,I've never seen a movie so forgettable and so memorable at the same time,"After the release of Infinity War, I had been bingewatching all the MCU movies to catch up with everyone before Endgame comes. And of course I was watching them all very hurriedly. The memorable movies were the ones that I still remember very clearly to date (it's been nearly 3 years), while the ones that were terrible and a drag to watch, I forgot them instantly. I'd say this movie comes between the two categories, and as far as I can think right now, it's the only one to be in this exceptional category.No matter what everyone says, I absolutely hate baby Groot. Cuteness only suits on creatures we are used to perceiving as cute. And thus Groot, a tree, looks very, very awkward with those chubby cheeks. It seems as though that face wasn't meant to be on that body. Also the entire point of his innocence is very irritating, especially the part where he wanted to use Rocket's buttons in spite of him repeatedly telling him not to do it. That scene does not even make any sense, since other than that part Rocket and Groot seem to understand each other literally all the time. Groot becomes stupid or intelligent, strong or weak as the story demands it, which is why I absolutely hate him.The visuals are absolutely gorgeous. Though it feels as though there is too much yellow in the colour palette and the overall tone is more inclined towards the warm shades, the CGI world is marvelous to look at. Ego is a great planet to look at. I have seen Ego in the comics now so I can't believe they were actually able to translate him so well on the screen. Seeing the spaceship battles always kept me on the edge of my seat. It's just like how I was expecting the movie to become better as time progresses.But the way the conflict between Peter and Ego came was very bad. First of all, the way they bonded was wrong by their characteristics. Peter is a gullible guy who always thinks by his emotions while Gamora is the sensible one. Yet here Peter was the one suspecting Ego while Gamora wanted him to trust Ego. And then the way Ego revealed his mother's death, ugh! Why did he even need to say that! Firstly no matter how much you are in a flow, you'd never say something like that. And secondly if he knows so much about Peter, how did he not know saying that would make him angry?I really liked Mantis. I never understood why her character arc was about her being ugly. She looked way better than Nebula or Drax. She was kinda cute though. I couldn't hear any of Drax's jokes so I won't be talking about him. Yondu was also a very nice character. As much as I rolled my eyes seeing him in the movie, I really enjoyed seeing what he had become. His character development is fantastic, because of the redeemed person that he is. His whistling and shooting arrows was very much fun to watch.Overall this movie is a very mixed bag of opinions for me. I think it's really bad compared to the first movie, but at the same time really entertaining compared to most MCU movies. There is so much CGI, so much world building in GotG that I can't possibly hate it. I'm just gonna try to remember this one. I had forgotten everything about it except the good scenes, so I had to watch the Cinemasins video to remember it. I hope Volume 3 surpasses my expectations.","[['the release', 'Infinity War', 'MCU', 'everyone', 'Endgame'], ['course'], ['date', 'a drag'], ['this movie', 'one', 'this exceptional category.No', 'matter', 'everyone', 'Groot'], ['Cuteness', 'cute'], ['Groot', 'a tree'], ['that face', 'that body'], ['the entire point', 'innocence', 'the part', 'Rocket', 'spite'], ['That scene', 'any sense', 'that part', 'Rocket', 'Groot', 'the time'], ['Groot', 'the story'], ['much yellow', 'the colour', 'palette', 'the overall tone', 'CGI', 'world'], ['Ego', 'a great planet'], ['Ego', 'the screen'], ['the spaceship', 'the edge', 'seat'], ['the movie', 'time', 'the way', 'the conflict', 'Peter', 'Ego'], ['First', 'the way'], ['Peter', 'a gullible guy', 'Gamora', 'the sensible one'], ['Peter', 'suspecting', 'Ego', 'Gamora', 'Ego'], ['the way', 'Ego', 'mother', 'death'], [], ['no matter', 'a flow', 'something'], ['Peter', 'Mantis'], ['character', 'arc'], ['way', 'Nebula', 'Drax'], ['kinda cute though'], ['Drax'], ['Yondu', 'nice character'], ['the movie'], ['character', 'development', 'the redeemed person'], ['whistling', 'shooting', 'much fun', 'this movie', 'mixed bag'], ['the first movie', 'the same time', 'MCU'], ['CGI', 'much world', 'building', 'GotG'], [], ['everything', 'Cinemasins', 'video'], ['Volume']]","[['release of Infinity War', 'MCU movies', 'everyone before Endgame'], ['course'], ['memorable movies', 'ones', 'date', 'years', 'ones', 'drag'], ['movie', 'categories', 'one', 'category.No matter', 'everyone', 'baby Groot'], ['Cuteness', 'suits on creatures', 'cute'], ['Groot', 'tree', 'chubby cheeks'], ['face', 'body'], ['entire point', 'innocence', 'part', 'Rocket', 'buttons in spite'], ['scene', 'sense', 'part Rocket', 'Groot', 'time'], ['Groot', 'story', 'him.The visuals'], ['much yellow', 'colour palette', 'overall tone', 'warm shades', 'CGI world'], ['Ego', 'great planet'], ['Ego', 'comics', 'screen'], ['spaceship', 'edge', 'seat'], ['movie', 'time', 'way', 'conflict between Peter', 'Ego'], ['First', 'way', 'characteristics'], ['Peter', 'gullible guy', 'emotions while Gamora', 'sensible one'], ['Peter', 'suspecting Ego', 'Gamora', 'Ego'], ['way Ego', 'mother', 'death'], [], ['matter', 'flow', 'something'], ['Peter', 'Mantis'], ['character arc'], ['way', 'Nebula or Drax'], ['kinda cute though'], ['Drax', 'jokes'], ['Yondu', 'nice character'], ['eyes', 'movie'], ['character development', 'redeemed person'], ['whistling', 'shooting arrows', 'much fun', 'movie', 'bag of opinions'], ['first movie', 'same time', 'MCU movies'], ['much CGI', 'world building', 'GotG'], [], ['everything', 'good scenes', 'Cinemasins video'], ['Volume', 'surpasses', 'expectations']]"

68,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,"The Autistic Reviewers have been waiting for this movie to come out for ages now. The biggest question is: Was it worth the wait? You bet it was! ""Set to the backdrop of Awesome Mixtape #2, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' continues the team's adventures as they unravel the mystery of Peter Quill's true parentage."" It picks exactly where the last one left off. The moment the film starts off you know you are in for the ride of your life. The intro is easily one of the most memorable, hilarious and action packed things you'll see in a superhero movie. The sequel never loses its touch with the humor the first one provided. It also had really nice touches of emotion/sadness to it. it's also filled with twists and turns that you'll never see coming.All the cast from the first one return. We have brand new characters in the movie such as Mantis (Pom Klementieff), Stakar Ogord (Sylvester Stallone), Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), and Ego (Kurt Russel). Kurt Russel really steals a lot of the show as soon as he is on screen. What's surprising is Yondu. He has way more screen time in this one than he does in the first one. Michael Rooker plays him so well. But once again it's Rocket (Bradley Cooper) who gets most of the humor in this one.It's action packed, it's never boring, it's hilarious and it's very emotional in loads of scenes with loads of twists and turns. What's not to love? Jay gives this 4.5/5 where as Nick gives this a 5/5 stars. Really check us out on facebook or Instagram!

69,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Remix,"While obviously not as fresh as the first movie, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 tries to expand and deepen all characters and their relationships. In general, everything that made the first movie great is even stronger here. Bigger and better action, evolving characters and over the top production. Jokes are still effective but if you just watched chapter one they will start feeling kind of repetitive.The plot and stupid villains were the biggest flaws of the previous entry, but things are getting better this time. The overall development is predictable and again there are still a couple of things happening just for the sake of it without a real reason, but it's a big step forward at least. The fact it has little ties to the MCU also helps to create something free from the usual themes and characters (it seems a lot of people did not appreciate that though). This movie is called ""Guardians of the Galaxy: Remix"" in Japan, and it kind of makes sense considering that it improves everything from the first movie without adding much new.","[['the first movie', 'Galaxy Vol'], [], ['everything', 'the first movie'], ['Bigger', 'action', 'the top production'], ['chapter', 'kind', 'repetitive.The', 'plot', 'flaws', 'the previous entry', 'this time'], ['The overall development', 'a couple', 'the sake', 'a real reason', 'a big step'], ['The fact', 'MCU', 'something', 'a lot'], ['This movie', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'Remix', 'Japan', 'kind', 'sense', 'everything', 'the first movie']]","[['first movie', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['tries', 'characters', 'relationships'], ['everything', 'first movie'], ['Bigger', 'action', 'characters', 'top production'], ['Jokes', 'chapter', 'kind of repetitive.The plot', 'stupid villains', 'flaws', 'previous entry', 'things', 'time'], ['overall development', 'couple of things', 'sake', 'real reason', 'big step'], ['fact', 'little ties', 'MCU', 'something', 'usual themes and characters', 'lot of people'], ['movie', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'Remix', 'Japan', 'kind', 'sense', 'everything', 'first movie']]"
70,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Back For More 3D Saving And Next One Already on The Way,"Like the first round, it appears it is always smart to keep the original formula together and keep going. James Gunn writes and directs this one, the same as the first one. A lot of the original cast is back too. It is done with jut a much fun and spirit as the first one.The formula is to mix up the characters into action using as much comedy as possible and then getting things rolling with a great soundtrack. This film does that tons more. The soundtrack is so well chosen a mix that by itself it is a great sounding film. The songs seem to fit every part of the film so well.The list of classic songs - 1. Mr. Blue Sky – Electric Light Orchestra 2. Fox on the Run – Sweet 3. Lake Shore Drive – Aliotta Haynes Jeremiah 4. The Chain – Fleetwood Mac 5. Bring it On Home to Me – Sam Cooke 6. Southern Nights – Glen Campbell 7. My Sweet Lord – George Harrison 8. Brandy You're a Fine Girl – Looking Glass 9. Come a Little Bit Closer – Jay and the Americans 10. Wham Bang Shang-A-Lang – Silver 11. Surrender – Cheap Trick 12. Father and Son – Yusuf / Cat Stevens 13. Flashlight – Parliament 14. Guardians Inferno – The Sneepers feat. David HasselhoffThere is a whole lot of Brandy, which is a great old song whose lyrics are worked into the plot lots. Of course Goldie Hawns husband, Kurt Rusell gets quite a bit of work here. Sly Stallone is not as busy but keeps himself relevant. The 4 women- Zoey, Pom, Karen, and Elizabeth keep things lively with the rival sisters and more. Stan Lee makes another cameo and is having more fun than anyone should be allowed to enjoy from his own creation. The plot will always be the same. This time, Ego (Russell) is one of 3 threats to the Galaxy, and is trying to enlist his son Peter Quill /Star Lord (Chris Pratt) to team up to build their own Galaxy as EGO has built himself a planet. There is also a Queen chasing Quill and there are some others and a step father who are involved.The plot is not what is important here. It is the comedy, the action, and the music. The film scores on all 3 points. At about 2 hours and 16 minutes it is long but not too long.

71,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"Action, drama, comedy and might even be better then the first one!","I went into the movie blind, I expected something OK-ish but Vol.3 might actually be better then the first one!The movie focuses more on developing the characters and shedding some light on their back stories making them more solid as people... well almost everyone, oddly enough there is just one character in the whole movie that doesn't gain any depth and yet manages to steal every single scene he's in and that's Drax (played by he of the infectious laugh Dave Bautista)Fast paced and action filled what really shines in this flick is oddly enough it's comedic timing and choice of sound track, The humor here comes at you from left field (or from Drax, just him laughing will tickle your funny bone!) so it's never expected.

Improbable results, luck, weird environments that do not follow any known physics and characters screaming at one another over the ambient sound.To paraphrase someones wisdom - the script wasn't the result of time, hard work, skill and craftsmanship. Things happen on the screen because the screen writers say so.

74,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"Tries to do a bit much that doesn't work so well, but the core strengths are there","The original Guardians of the Galaxy was quite a fresh entry in the crowded world of Marvel. With so many famous characters we at least have heard of, and so many films all crashing into one another with cross-overs, references, solo films, and so on, the arrival of a nostalgia soaked film which had a great sense of humor, fun, and a lack of 'big important things' made for great entertainment. Accordingly it was a big hit, which puts pressure on it as a sequel and (more importantly) as a franchise and part of a bigger product. In short though, it does manage to deliver on the same strengths that the first film had – although that is not the whole story.The second film opens with confirmation of that silly fun – an epic battle against a space monster plays out to the background of Groot dancing, and only becomes the focus to allow for other characters to show themselves again and join the fun. This sense of silly fun, combined with funny dialogue, is the core of the film and it is consistent throughout. Add to that the music, the action, and the overblown nature of it and it is a continuation of the strengths of the first film. There is other content in here too. There are themes of family in 3 different threads, with emotional content between characters and factions. Not all of this works, and it does make it feel a bit heavier than it can bear at times. That said, while it doesn't totally work, it is still well judged since less time on it would have lost a lot in the film, while more time would have tipped the balanced too much in that direction – although these individual moments of the film don't totally sit easily with the humor or pace.The effects and action look good and, while frantic and busy, I didn't find that they overwhelmed with empty noise in the way that can easily happen with these things. The cast are all good when it comes to the comedy elements, although not all so well when the emotional stuff comes around (Saldana/Gillan I thought didn't work so well – although Rooker/Cooper did). Pratt likewise is best when asked to be fun, and less effective when processing a lot about his father. Bautista stands out as the best I think – perhaps because so much of his material was heavily 'fun' focused. The many famous faces in small roles add to the weight of the film (not in a good way), and although they do add value, they also distract and fill out space.Although it does try to do a bit too much, and doesn't stay away from areas where it is weaker, the sequel plays to its strengths enough to please fans of the first film, and to carry it through the moments and aspects which do not work as well as the core.","[['Galaxy', 'a fresh entry', 'the crowded world', 'Marvel'], ['solo', 'the arrival', 'a nostalgia', 'film', 'a great sense', 'humor', 'fun', 'a lack', ""'big"", 'great entertainment'], ['a big hit', 'pressure', 'a sequel', 'a franchise', 'part', 'product'], ['the first film', 'the whole story.The second film', 'confirmation', 'that silly fun', 'an epic battle', 'a space', 'monster', 'the background', 'Groot', 'dancing', 'the focus', 'the fun'], ['This sense', 'silly fun', 'funny dialogue', 'the core', 'the film'], ['Add', 'the music', 'the action', 'the overblown nature', 'a continuation', 'the first film'], ['other content'], ['family', 'emotional content'], ['a bit'], ['time', 'a lot', 'the film', 'time', 'that direction', 'the film', 'the humor', 'pace.The', 'action', 'look', 'empty noise', 'the way'], ['The cast', 'the comedy', 'the emotional stuff', 'Saldana/Gillan', 'Rooker/Cooper'], ['Pratt', 'likewise', 'a lot', 'father'], ['Bautista', 'material', ""'fun""], ['the weight', 'the film', 'a good way', 'value', 'the sequel', 'the first film', 'the core']]","[['original Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'fresh entry', 'world of Marvel'], ['many famous characters', 'many films', 'cross-overs', 'references', 'solo films', 'arrival', 'nostalgia', 'film', 'sense of humor', 'fun', ""lack of 'big"", 'important things', 'great entertainment'], ['big hit', 'pressure', 'sequel', 'franchise and part', 'product'], ['same strengths', 'first film', 'whole story.The second film', 'confirmation', 'silly fun', 'epic battle', 'space monster', 'background of Groot dancing', 'focus', 'other characters', 'fun'], ['sense', 'silly fun', 'funny dialogue', 'core', 'film'], ['Add', 'music', 'action', 'overblown nature', 'continuation', 'strengths', 'first film'], ['other content'], ['themes of family', 'different threads', 'content between characters', 'factions'], ['works', 'bit', 'times'], ['time', 'lot', 'film', 'time', 'direction', 'individual moments', 'film', 'humor', 'pace.The effects', 'action look', 'empty noise', 'way', 'things'], ['cast', 'comedy elements', 'emotional stuff', 'Saldana/Gillan', 'Rooker/Cooper'], ['Pratt likewise', 'lot', 'father'], ['Bautista', 'material', ""'fun""], ['small roles', 'weight', 'film', 'good way', 'value', 'areas', 'sequel', 'strengths', 'fans', 'first film', 'moments and aspects', 'core']]"

"" Hmmm okay then . I'll say this comment continues more thought than James Gunn has put in to the plotting of his screenplay. There's little in the way of plot. Some nice characters get kidnapped by bad characters but end up escaping from bad characters. Bad character tries to kill good character but fails. Different species of nice characters talk then along comes bad characters to spoil these quiet moments. Oh and there's few quite moments in the overlong runtime because this is a noisy, plot less mess of a blockbuster I also have a bit of a problem with wondering who it's marketed for. It has Russell and Stallone who are legends from the 1980s along with references to KNIGHT RIDER and David Hassellhoff which will mean absolutely nothing to younger audiences and the nature of the film means more discerning mature audiences like myself will be bored by the constant noise and bluster.

78,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"Fun To Look At, Grating To Listen To","Just got out of the theater and here are my initial thoughts: stunning visuals and CGI-work, a sub-par plot with forced jokes, and a lack of an emotional payoff.I probably wouldn't have seen this one if I wasn't forced into it in a group setting (I'm really starting to suffer from Marvel fatigue) but I went into it with an open mind. I was shocked that the first one was so well received, I thought it was average; all the fuss over it always really confused me. You'd imagine my surprise when I click over to Vol. 2's IMDb page and find it above an 8!Vol. 2 is definitely worse than it's predecessor. The plot is convoluted and never really feels like it has high stakes. What exactly is the villain's motivation in all this? I don't really understand. The wrinkle involving the villain being his dad had the potential to be great but was done improperly. In order for that to work, you'd need your main character to have some type of emotional struggle as lines are drawn in the sand between choosing his ""family"" and choosing his father. Instead, Kurt Russell almost immediately and inexplicably tells his son that he killed his mother. WHY?! This ultra-intelligent demigod had to have known how poor of an idea it was to tell him this.Speaking of poor plot, what was that whole subplot between Rocket and Yondu? ""We're both jerks so we share a common bond."" Okay movie, whatever you say. This movie's over 2 hours, this subplot is completely unnecessary. I'm already checking my watch.Now to my biggest problem: the humor. While the 80's nostalgia references from the original felt fun and organic, all of it in here felt forced and dull. No one in a serious argument should be dropping ""Cheers"" references to someone they must surely know has no idea what you're talking about. I was not expecting all the potty humor either. I don't mind that kind of stuff if it's done well but all of it in here was extremely cringe-worthy. Groot's remission back to a tiny twig just screamed of toy development. Marvel's going to be making Baby Groot merchandise until they milk that river dry. I was rolling my eyes at the opening credit sequence involving him. What are we doing, Marvel? A lot of this felt targeted to a far younger audience than last time.As far as positives go, it's all about the visuals. There are some stunning shots in this movie (the overhead shot of the arrow whistling around the ship immediately comes to mind). Marvel always does a good job at doing that so, at the very least, you can walk out of a theater remembering some pretty cool cinematography.Finally the conclusion, it felt like a dud. I'm suppose to feel emotionally attached to this Yondu bandit that kidnapped our protagonist and was a villain for over half the duration of these movies? He said it himself, he hasn't done a good deed his entire life. Because he changes his tune in the last ten minutes and dies like a martyr I'm suppose to sympathize with this fella? I just can't. Maybe we're meant to vicariously sympathize through Quill since he sees Yondu as a father figure but I just couldn't buy into it.I've lost more and more interest in the Marvel movies and this maybe the last straw.

81,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,The team of hero misfits return,"I think of Guardian of the Galaxy has the red haired step brother to The Avengers. Funny space adventure, with some dramatic moment. All the actors have good chemistry, and really feel comfortable in there roles. CGI Rocket Racoon voiced by Bradley Cooper, and Groot voiced by Vin Diesel really stole a lot of scenes. I was eagerly waiting for the sequel.The funny moments are always the best parts, but are some dramatic moments also, but never over shadow the funny parts. Our favorite hero team of misfits get into more trouble and find more adventures. Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana really shine again as Star Lord and Gamora. So does Rocket and Groot once again voiced by Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. Michael Rooker is quite the scene steal er as Yondu. And Karen Gillan is memorable as Nebula.

83,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) Review - 8.4/10,"This is one of the most underrated films in the entirety of the MCU. In my opinion, it's the funniest MCU film, the action isn't the best, but they make up for it with a compelling villain, in Ego. The score is even better than the first, in my opinion, and the only reason I don't think it's better than the original is some of it's charm is gone by now.

84,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Family Time,"When a sequel is released following in the footsteps of a popular and well-loved movie the bar is set high by any and all going to see it. Expectations are high and if the follow up doesn't equal that of the first film it could result in the end of a series or low box office figures. Termed the ""sophomore slump"" more than one second film has fallen prey to this occurring.I've loved all of the Marvel Universe films (and Netflix series) to date, more so than any that DC has released where only WONDER WOMAN has succeeded. I enjoyed GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY immensely, a perfect combination of action, comic book love, special effects and humor. When the sequel, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2 came out I was there the first week to see it. I left disappointed feeling it hadn't lived up to my expectations. So I was anxious for it to come out on disc so I could watch it again and see it through different eyes, eyes not filled with expectations of the previous film. I'm glad I did.The movie starts in the distant past as Peter Quill's mother Meredith rides down the road in an open topped convertible singing ""Brandy"" as her handsome young beau (Kurt Russell) drives. They end up in a woods where he shows her something he has planted in the ground and both convey their love for one another. Fast forward to outer space.The Guardians have been hired by the Sovereign to protect their all-important batteries from a marauding inter-dimensional monster. As it arrives the battle begins as does my favorite part of the film. Baby Groot hooks up a sound system to play music, something Peter aka Star Lord (Chris Pratt) enjoys. With the tune ""Mr. Blue Sky"" blaring from the speakers baby Groot dances across the battlefield oblivious to the raging fight taking place around him. If it doesn't make your heart dance with joy to see him you have no heart.The team is victorious and get their reward – Nebula (Karen Gillan) Gamora's (Zoe Saldana) sister. Peter warns them to be cautious as the Sovereign are an easily offended group which of course results in Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper) cracking wise at their expense. Heading out into space they are then attacked by the Sovereign, looking for the batteries stolen by Rocket which he failed to mention. As things appear to be at their worst another spaceship shows up with a man on top who obliterates the remaining Sovereign ships.Crash landing and beginning repairs that same spaceship lands and out walks a man known as Ego who informs Peter that he is his father. Here before him is the man he's been searching for all these years. A man who has been searching for Peter as well. While Rocket and Groot remain behind to fix the ship, with Nebula still a prisoner, the rest go with Ego to his planet at the far edge of the galaxy. But what is it that he really wants? This will become the problem all face eventually.As this unfolds we also find out what has become of Yondu (Michael Rooker), Peter's once father figure and the man who was tracking him down in the first film. We learn that his particular group of Ravagers were exiled because of his taking Peter years ago. At his lowest he is approached by the Sovereign to find the Guardians and retrieve their batteries.Two themes run throughout this film. The first is that of family and fathers in particular. The Guardians are more than just a rag tag group of adventurers. Each has lost something or someone in their past and they have bonded together as a family in their time together. And each father figure has some flaw that makes them not the father they could have been but all attempt to redeem themselves for the most part save one. This presents a much deeper film than one would expect from a comic based movie.The movie entertains on all levels from the stunning special effects visuals to the story telling itself. The acting is amazing when you consider that beneath the bluster and wise cracking heroics on display is that search for answers to familial matters. This includes not just fathers but sisters as well with Nebula and Gamora trying to find their own answers. In addition to that there are some belly busting funny moments as well, nearly all involving Drax (Dave Batista) who does a fantastic job with them.On second viewing, without preconceived ideas in mind, I loved this movie. It might not be equal to the first but it is very close. The concepts that run through this film strike at the heart which is never a bad thing when handled well. Here it is handled exceptionally well. This is a movie to be added to any and all collections and watched more than once.","[['a sequel', 'well-loved movie', 'the bar'], ['the follow', 'the first film', 'the end', 'a series', 'low box', 'office'], ['sophomore slump', 'second film', 'Marvel Universe', 'Netflix', 'series', 'date', 'DC', 'WONDER WOMAN'], ['GUARDIANS', 'THE GALAXY', 'a perfect combination', 'action', 'comic book', 'love', 'humor'], ['the sequel', 'GUARDIANS', 'THE GALAXY VOL'], ['the first week'], ['disappointed feeling'], ['the previous film'], ['movie', 'the distant past', 'Peter Quill', 'mother', 'Meredith', 'the road', 'an open topped', 'Brandy', 'handsome', 'young beau', 'Kurt Russell'], ['something', 'the ground', 'love'], ['space.The', 'Sovereign', 'inter-dimensional monster'], ['the battle', 'favorite part', 'the film'], ['Baby Groot', 'a sound', 'system', 'music', 'something', 'Peter', 'aka', 'Star Lord', 'Chris Pratt'], ['the tune', 'Mr. Blue Sky', 'blaring', 'Groot', 'the battlefield', 'fight', 'place'], ['heart', 'dance', 'joy', 'no heart.The', 'team', 'reward', '–', 'Nebula', 'Karen Gillan', 'Gamora', 'Zoe Saldana', 'sister'], ['Peter', 'Sovereign', 'group', 'course', 'Rocket', 'voice', 'Bradley Cooper', 'wise', 'expense'], ['space', 'Sovereign', 'Rocket'], ['another spaceship', 'a man', 'top', 'Sovereign', 'ships.Crash', 'landing', 'same spaceship', 'a man', 'Ego', 'Peter', 'father'], ['the man'], ['A man', 'Peter'], ['Rocket', 'Groot', 'the ship', 'Nebula', 'a prisoner', 'the rest', 'Ego', 'planet', 'edge', 'the galaxy'], [], ['the problem', 'Yondu', 'Michael Rooker', 'Peter', 'father figure', 'the man', 'the first film'], ['particular group', 'Peter'], ['Sovereign', 'batteries.Two', 'this film'], ['family'], ['a rag', 'tag', 'group'], ['something', 'someone', 'past', 'a family', 'time'], ['each father', 'figure', 'some flaw', 'the father', 'all attempt', 'part'], ['film', 'movie.The movie', 'the story'], ['The acting', 'beneath', 'the bluster', 'wise', 'display', 'search'], ['Nebula', 'Gamora'], ['addition', 'Drax', 'Dave Batista', 'a fantastic job', 'them.On second viewing', 'mind', 'this movie'], [], ['this film', 'strike', 'the heart', 'a bad thing'], [], ['a movie']]","[['sequel', 'footsteps', 'well-loved movie', 'bar'], ['Expectations', 'follow', 'first film', 'end', 'series', 'box office figures'], ['sophomore slump', 'second film', 'Marvel Universe films', 'Netflix series', 'date', 'DC', 'WONDER WOMAN'], ['GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY', 'combination of action', 'book love', 'special effects and humor'], ['sequel', 'GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL'], ['first week'], ['disappointed feeling', 'expectations'], ['disc', 'different eyes', 'eyes', 'expectations', 'previous film'], ['movie starts', 'past as Peter Quill', 'mother Meredith', 'road', 'open topped', 'Brandy', 'handsome', 'young beau', 'Kurt Russell'], ['woods', 'something', 'ground', 'love'], ['space.The Guardians', 'Sovereign', 'all-important batteries', 'inter-dimensional monster'], ['battle', 'favorite part', 'film'], ['Baby Groot', 'sound system', 'music', 'something Peter aka Star Lord', 'Chris Pratt'], ['tune', 'Mr. Blue Sky', 'blaring', 'speakers', 'Groot dances', 'battlefield', 'fight', 'place'], ['heart dance', 'joy', 'heart.The team', 'reward – Nebula', 'Karen Gillan', 'Gamora', 'Zoe Saldana', 'sister'], ['Peter', 'Sovereign', 'group', 'course results', 'Rocket', 'voice of Bradley Cooper', 'wise', 'expense'], ['space', 'Sovereign', 'batteries', 'Rocket'], ['things', 'spaceship', 'man on top', 'Sovereign ships.Crash landing', 'repairs', 'spaceship lands', 'walks', 'man', 'Ego', 'Peter', 'father'], ['man', 'years'], ['man', 'Peter'], ['Rocket and Groot', 'ship', 'Nebula', 'prisoner', 'rest', 'Ego', 'planet', 'edge', 'galaxy'], [], ['problem', 'Yondu', 'Michael Rooker', 'Peter', 'father figure', 'man', 'first film'], ['group of Ravagers', 'Peter years'], ['Sovereign', 'Guardians', 'batteries.Two themes', 'film'], ['family and fathers'], ['Guardians', 'rag tag group', 'adventurers'], ['something or someone', 'past', 'family', 'time'], ['father figure', 'flaw', 'father', 'attempt', 'part'], ['film', 'movie entertains', 'levels', 'effects visuals', 'story'], ['acting', 'beneath', 'bluster and wise', 'heroics on display', 'search for answers', 'familial matters'], ['fathers but sisters', 'Nebula and Gamora', 'own answers'], ['addition', 'funny moments', 'Drax', 'Dave Batista', 'fantastic job', 'them.On second viewing', 'ideas in mind', 'movie'], [], ['concepts', 'film strike', 'heart', 'bad thing'], [], ['movie', 'collections']]"
85,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Laugh out loud funny movie filled with many touching moments that will make you cry!,"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 is such a glorious celebration of all that's enjoyable about going to the movies. It makes you feel you've gotten your money's worth, from the ticket price to all the expensive food and drink items. Everyone in the theater walked out chatting and laughing about the movie. I can't think of a way to make a more enjoyable movie than GOTG 2.From the beginning, the MARVEL STUDIOS logo has changed. While it's slowly creeping on screen, we used to see comic pages flipping. That's now replaced with movie footage, and the music is now epic, making the MS logo feel more classy and majestic.The opening credits scene is just so creative, and a scene like that could very well be one of the best ending scenes in another movie. But in GOTG 2, it's just the opening! Looking back on the entire film, I can't believe in this age where we're all so used to seeing flashy space and combat action scenes, everything gets better and better as this movie rolls along towards the ending.This is a really character-driven movie, and every single main actor gets fantastic screen time. No one is in the background. They all shine. Jokes are non-stop, and there are WAY more jokes in this sequel. Some of the humor is so unexpected and wacky that you'll just burst out loud laughing! You'll hear other people in the theater continue to laugh as the movie rolls on and you'll laugh again just thinking about what happened on screen.As funny as this movie gets, you'll be pleasantly blindsided with some extremely heartwarming scenes between characters. How can a movie make people laugh so hard, then the next minute have everyone sobbing, or at least fighting back tears? If you're the type of movie-goer who likes to brag that you didn't cry through an emotional scene, prepare to get tested. GOTG 2 has many emotional scenes, and they happen at the weirdest, most unexpected times. My bet is, you WILL cry at least once. There's just too many good scenes coming at you and you'll stumble. This movie is such a rare roller-coaster of emotional ups and downs. Enjoy the ride! The end credits are filled with things to keep you sitting in your chair. Don't make the mistake of walking out. There are something like 5 or 6 end scenes dispersed through the credits. You'll see people in the theater standing to leave, then sitting. Standing again, then sitting down. There's just so much going on in the end credits!From start to finish, this movie has everything and the kitchen sink thrown in. It's all bigger, better, funnier and way more emotional than the first GOTG, and easily the most entertaining thing you might witness this year in the theater. Don't miss this movie!","[['Galaxy Vol'], ['a glorious celebration'], ['money', 'worth', 'the ticket', 'price', 'the expensive food', 'drink'], ['Everyone', 'the theater', 'chatting', 'the movie'], ['a way', 'enjoyable movie', 'GOTG', 'the beginning', 'MARVEL STUDIOS', 'logo'], ['screen'], ['movie', 'footage', 'the music', 'MS', 'logo', 'feel', 'majestic.The opening', 'scene', 'a scene', 'another movie'], ['GOTG', 'the opening'], ['the entire film', 'this age', 'flashy space', 'combat', 'action', 'everything', 'this movie', 'the ending.This', 'character-driven movie', 'every single main actor', 'fantastic screen', 'time'], ['No one', 'the background'], [], ['WAY', 'this sequel'], ['the humor', 'loud laughing'], ['the theater', 'the movie', 'screen.As', 'funny', 'this movie'], ['a movie', 'make', 'the next minute', 'everyone', 'sobbing'], ['the type', 'movie-goer', 'an emotional scene', 'prepare'], ['GOTG'], ['bet'], [], ['This movie', 'a rare roller-coaster'], ['the ride'], ['The end', 'chair'], ['the mistake'], ['something', 'end'], ['the theater'], [], ['the end', 'start', 'this movie', 'everything', 'the kitchen'], ['way', 'GOTG', 'entertaining thing', 'this year', 'the theater'], ['this movie']]","[['Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['glorious celebration', 'movies'], ['money', 'worth', 'ticket price', 'expensive food', 'drink items'], ['Everyone', 'theater', 'chatting', 'movie'], ['way', 'movie than GOTG', 'beginning', 'MARVEL STUDIOS logo'], ['screen', 'comic pages'], ['movie footage', 'music', 'MS logo feel', 'opening credits scene', 'scene', 'scenes', 'movie'], ['GOTG', 'opening'], ['entire film', 'age', 'flashy space', 'combat action scenes', 'everything', 'movie', 'towards', 'ending.This', 'character-driven movie', 'single main actor', 'screen time'], ['one', 'background'], [], ['Jokes', 'WAY', 'jokes', 'sequel'], ['humor', 'loud laughing'], ['other people', 'theater', 'movie rolls', 'screen.As funny', 'movie', 'scenes between characters'], ['movie make people', 'next minute', 'everyone sobbing', 'tears'], ['type of movie-goer', 'emotional scene', 'prepare'], ['GOTG', 'many emotional scenes', 'unexpected times'], ['bet'], ['many good scenes'], ['movie', 'rare roller-coaster', 'emotional ups and downs'], ['ride'], ['end credits', 'things', 'chair'], ['mistake'], ['something', 'end scenes', 'credits'], ['people', 'theater'], [], ['end', 'start', 'movie', 'everything', 'kitchen'], ['way', 'first GOTG', 'entertaining thing', 'year', 'theater'], ['movie']]"
86,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"Funny, Emotional, Smart, Characterful, Beautiful, not as good as Vol.1","I'll get this out of the way first; Vol. 2 doesn't beat it's predecessor, in fact it may not even equal it. Guardians of the Galaxy was a pure masterpiece of a Space Opera, and Vol. 2 never quite meets the same nigh-perfection of the first film. But I won't waste this review comparing the two movies, because the only result of that is a negative impression of Vol. 2, and that's not the impression I want to paint at all.Vol. 2 is a Guardians movie through-and-through, utilising the same charm of the first movie to re-create it's unique footprint in the moviescape. It's bright and colourful, it's filled to the brim with a unique brand of humour, it touches on a deeper, more emotional core, it's soundtrack is made up of classic rock and pop from the 70s, and it puts it's characters before story or action. Nonetheless it does feel painfully aware of where it's come from and attempting to recapture that same feeling of the first, to the point where it can sometimes feel a little forced or unnatural.The story, in an Empire Strikes Back kind of way, splits the team up, gives the ""main"" character a father figure, and brings them all together at the end. Fatherhood and family is a massive theme that permeates almost every conversation in the movie. Starlord finally gets to meet his father after nearly thirty years, while Drax continues to struggle with the loss of his wife and daughter, and Gamora and Nebula come to terms with the awful treatment they suffered from their father. Yondu and Rocket share a heartbreaking moment when they realise their loss of any kind of family gives them more in common than they ever thought as well. The Guardians are starting to turn into the space-faring version of Dom Toretto's team in the Fast and Furious franchise, but arguably do it better and touch at the emotional core of family better than any Fast and Furious movie ever could.Vol. 2 is probably the funniest movie in the entire MCU so far, but that's not necessarily a good thing. I mean, yeah, it is. It's full to the brim with jokes, gags, one- liners, and running humour. It's easily the funniest movie I've seen in a long time, and remains quotable long after the credits have rolled. However when it comes to jokes, it just seems to keep chucking them at the screen in the hopes that most of them stick. Unfortunately a lot of them don't. Some of the gags feel forced in and ruin the already shaky pacing of the movie. One prominent example being a cool 360 montage of the team assembled and ready to take on the villain, except it's ruined by a rock knocking one of them over in the name of laughs. It was a cool moment, it didn't need comedy to make it more enjoyable than it already was.The same criticism applies to the film's emotional moments. I'm not going to lie, Vol. 2 is surprisingly emotional, balancing out the overabundance of humour with some really serious, heartbreaking moments that offer a true insight into the deeper characters of the cast. But again it felt like some of it was forced in. As mentioned, Yondu and Rocket's exchange is really good, and Nebula's desperation to ""win"" over her sister has a sad tinge to it, but it never quite reaches the complete gut-wrenching emotion of the first film (yeah, I'm sorry, I had to use the comparison here). Vol. 1 has the second most tearjerking opening of any movie, and learning about Drax and Rocket's past was a genuine punch to the gut when you realise how far they've fallen from pure loneliness and lack of love and family. Vol. 2 never quite hits it despite it's numerous attempts. The closest it gets is the funeral at very the end.Finally (yes, finally) the soundtrack is unsurprisingly great; full of 70s classics from the likes of Fleetwood Mac to Cat Stevens, Electric Light Orchestra to Parliament, Sam Cooke to George Harrison. Sometimes they serve a narrative purpose in the movie, sometimes they're used to create a juxtaposition to what's going on on-screen, and sometimes they're just used really well as part of the soundtrack's core sound. The score by Tyler Bates is also pretty good, but falls into the forgettable nature most Marvel scores suffer from. That said the Avengers theme does protrude on more than one occasion which was a really nice touch, tying what is ultimately an added extra in the MCU to the wider universe.Vol. 2 does not compare favourably to the first one three years ago, but as Vol. 1 was a near masterpiece, that's not saying a whole lot. On it's own merits, or even compared to other Marvel movies, Vol. 2 is still pretty great. It has Marvel's most engaging villain since Loki, the most emotional resonance since Vol. 1, and is likely the funniest movie so far. It's largest downfall is trying too hard to recapture the charm of the original rather than forging it's own path. It throws in a lot of attempts to build up the Cosmic side of Marvel, and a lot of them work really well, but it sometimes detracted from the main story a little. The Sovereign's role in the climax was used as little more than motivation to come back in Vol. 3 and introduce a fan-favourite, for instance. I give Vol. 2 a low 9/10; not as good as Vol. 1, or even Winter Soldier (2014 is still Marvel's best year by far), but it's still up there with the best of them; a solid superhero movie, a solid space opera. Bring on Ragnarok later in the year when the line between Avengers and Cosmic is blurred even further!","[['this out', 'the way', 'Vol'], ['predecessor', 'fact'], ['Galaxy', 'a pure masterpiece',

89,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,A fun sci-fi/superhero sequel,"These comments assume viewers have seen the first film and are thus familiar with the established characters.As this sequel opens are heroes are protecting crucial batteries from an interdimensional threat in exchange for them handing over Nebula, the criminal sister of Gamora. Unfortunately Rocket steals the batteries and soon the Sovereign Race are hunting then down. They manage to escape with the help of a stranger who turns out to be Ego; somebody who is more than a man and is closely connected to one of the team. Quill, Gamora and Drax accompany Ego, and his empath associate Mantis, to his home world; Ego's Planet. Meanwhile Rocket and Baby Groot guard Nebula. Somewhat inevitably things go wrong for both groups and once again they are forced to save the galaxy.I really enjoyed this film; I know it is part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and thus a superhero movie but it feels more like science fiction with its space based setting, assorted aliens and general atmosphere... that suited my tastes nicely. The story is fun providing plenty of excuses for impressive action scenes and some nice twists. More importantly though it gives us good character development for existing characters and some good new characters. As one would expect the special effects are most impressive making it easy to suspend ones disbelief and enjoy the ride. The cast do a fine job making their characters fun to watch and providing humour that isn't overly forced. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of the first film; if you haven't seen the first film, and like fun sci-fi action, I'd advise watching that first then this... then look forward to the promised third film being released.","[['the first film', 'characters.As', 'this sequel', 'an interdimensional threat', 'exchange', 'Nebula', 'the criminal sister', 'Gamora'], ['Rocket', 'Sovereign Race'], ['the help', 'a stranger', 'Ego', 'somebody', 'a man', 'the team'], ['Quill', 'Gamora', 'Drax', 'accompany', 'Ego', 'empath', 'associate', 'Mantis', 'home', 'world', 'Ego', 'Planet'], ['Rocket', 'Baby Groot', 'guard', 'Nebula'], ['the galaxy.I', 'this film', 'part', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe', 'a superhero movie', 'science', 'fiction', 'space', 'setting', 'general atmosphere'], ['The story', 'plenty', 'impressive action'], ['good character', 'development'], ['disbelief', 'the ride'], ['The cast', 'a fine job', 'humour'], ['the first film', 'the first film', 'fun sci-fi action', 'the promised third film']]","[['comments', 'viewers', 'first film', 'characters.As', 'sequel', 'heroes', 'crucial batteries', 'threat in exchange', 'Nebula', 'sister of Gamora'], ['Rocket', 'batteries', 'Sovereign Race'], ['help', 'stranger', 'Ego', 'somebody', 'man', 'team'], ['Quill', 'Gamora', 'Drax accompany Ego', 'empath associate Mantis', 'home world', 'Ego', 'Planet'], ['Rocket', 'Baby Groot guard Nebula'], ['things', 'groups', 'galaxy.I', 'film', 'part', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe', 'superhero movie', 'science fiction', 'space', 'setting', 'aliens', 'general atmosphere', 'tastes'], ['story', 'plenty of excuses', 'action scenes', 'nice twists'], ['character development', 'characters', 'good new characters'], ['special effects', 'ones disbelief', 'ride'], ['cast', 'fine job', 'characters', 'humour'], ['fans', 'first film', 'first film', 'fun sci-fi action', 'promised third film']]"

91,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,They've done it again!,"Marvel has made a superhero movie how it should be made! This movie again is fresh, funny and interesting the whole time. This is so much better than some of the earlier movies that come before it. And as far as sequels go, this does a great job of not sucking like most other sequels.The opening scene is so smart and unique, with focus being on baby Groot (who is such a great character, loved by many I'm sure) whilst the characters battle in the background. It was funny and it gets the main idea of what superhero movies need to be about, the characters! Not action. Action should always be secondary or in the background and the character development always needs to be central. The superhero movies that have all action have never been rated very highly.From here the movie goes from strength to strength with the cast being the real powerhouse. Every character is likeable, Drax for me especially I found hilarious! His laugh and dry honest comments were always appreciated.One issue I did have with the movie was the spaceship scene, flying through the comets, seemed like an exact copy of a scene out of the original Star Wars triology. Plus it then got quite far fetched when Gomorrah caught a flying Draw in the spaceship and then proceeded to hold onto a piece of the ship whilst holding Drax for a ridiculous amount of time. This was too far fetched and needed to be rewritten.Peter Quill and his father was an interesting story, and had some good twists and jokes throughout. The development of what it means to be a father vs a Dad was also playd out well throughout the second half of the movie.Rocket also gets some important screen time to rise up as a hero alongside Yondu. Both of these characters get redemption in the end and Yondu's sacrifice was emotional and made sense.The only other problem I had with the movie was the fact that they threw people out into space to die and they were dead with a matter of seconds, however when Peter Quill is thrown out into space in the previous movie he gets at least 20 seconds of life before being taken into a ship and still survives. This doesn't line up, but could be excused for Peter's god like abilities.Overall this was another great edition to the Marvel Universe and ultimately if it wasn't for these strong contributions, I would ultimately not care about Marvel at all. These characters play a siginficant part in making Marvel what it is today.

92,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Baby Groot!,"The opening credit scene with Baby Groot dancing (all while the other Guardians are protecting the Anulax batteries) is hands-down one of the best moments in the MCU. Drax and Baby Groot made me laugh out loud more times than I can count.What keeps this from being a top tier film for me personally is the increased vulgarity. I am just not a fan of Rocket's irreverent and blatantly offensive dialogue. In addition, the middle act dragged a bit at times. That being said, I loved the first 10 minutes and the third act of the film.The climactic fight scene on Ego's planet (which lasted a whopping 28 minutes) spectacularly toyed with my emotions as I laughed, cried and yelled at the screen.

94,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,We need a Drax and Mantis show NOW,"SYNOPSIS:
Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is found by his long lost father, Ego (Kurt Russell), and learns a lot about himself. He also finds out that it might not be as good of a reunion that he was hoping for.REVIEW:
A step up from the first film. *Insert outrage and hate in the comments*. Someone had to say it and I'm apparently the only one man enough to admit it. We get a deeper dive into the mental of several characters and it was funnier. Don't get me wrong, I have the same qualms that I had from the first film and I also feel that this movie had a couple of terribly unfunny lines. Like, super cringe. Almost makes it worse than the first film, but not quite. On top of learning about who Peter is, why Yondu (Michael Rooker) and Rocket (Bradley Cooper) are the way they are, why Nebula (Karen Gillian) acts the way she does, how Drax (Dave Bautista) feels deep down behind his strong and cheerful facade. This film gives us so much and then it just throws interactions between Drax and Mantis (Pom Klementieff) in there like we're all angels and saints. We don't deserve those moments, but James Gunn goes ""here, take this, cherish it, hold on and never let go."" Or at least I imagine that's what he would say to us. In this film, I also feel the villain was a genuine threat. I do wish that Starlord wasn't just automatically incredible at what he just found out he could do. Other than that, I really felt this was a strong film with slight potential to do more, but still good nonetheless. 7.6/10.","[['SYNOPSIS', 'Peter Quill', 'Chris Pratt', 'long lost', 'father', 'Ego', 'Kurt Russell', 'a lot'], ['a reunion', 'for.REVIEW', 'A step', 'the first film'], ['*', 'Insert', 'outrage', 'hate'], ['Someone', 'man'], ['a deeper dive', 'the mental'], ['the same qualms', 'the first film', 'this movie', 'a couple'], ['super cringe'], ['the first film'], ['top', 'Peter', 'Yondu', 'Michael Rooker', 'Rocket', 'Bradley Cooper', 'the way', 'Nebula', 'Karen Gillian', 'the way', 'Drax', 'Dave Bautista', 'cheerful facade'], ['This film', 'Drax', 'Mantis', 'Pom Klementieff'], ['James Gunn'], [], ['this film', 'the villain', 'a genuine threat'], ['Starlord'], ['a strong film', 'slight potential'], []]","[['SYNOPSIS', 'Peter Quill', 'Chris Pratt', 'lost father', 'Ego', 'Kurt Russell', 'lot'], ['reunion', 'for.REVIEW', 'step', 'first film'], ['* Insert outrage', 'hate', 'comments'], ['Someone', 'man'], ['deeper dive', 'mental', 'several characters'], ['same qualms', 'first film', 'movie', 'couple', 'unfunny lines'], ['super cringe'], ['first film'], ['top', 'Peter', 'Yondu', 'Michael Rooker', 'Rocket', 'Bradley Cooper', 'way', 'Nebula', 'Karen Gillian', 'way', 'Drax', 'Dave Bautista', 'cheerful facade'], ['film', 'interactions between Drax', 'Mantis', 'Pom Klementieff', 'angels and saints'], ['moments', 'James Gunn'], [], ['film', 'villain', 'genuine threat'], ['Starlord'], ['strong film', 'slight potential'], []]"
95,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,James Gunn strikes back,"This has to be my most underrated MCU film, people rate it much low but for me it cracks top tier.Yes it drags but I love those portions as it settles the characters much more, much more dialogues and character moments. It also doesn't throw the villain at your face but builds relationships.Baby Groot is cute, Rocket does everything we loved about that character from first one. Rocket-Groot bomb sequence is one of my favourite sequence this movie is filled with many other comedy gold.Drax comedy is still my favourite, Peter having sexual emotion for Gamora and Drax screaming top of his lungs cracked me the most. Drax and Mentis just starting their weird relation.Gamora & Nebula's bonding thickens with fantastic toxic sister-sister relationships were explored. Peters relationship with his Father, being set up as a alien in first movie got good continuity and explains a lot more about Peter getting kidnapped by Ravengers. Peter at last playing ball with his father. Peter taking quick reaction of shooting his father just as he hear about tumor, Peter can't control his emotion.Yondu is the best daddy, his arc and redemption felt so emotional with original Ravengers returning to celebrate that beautiful funeral, heads off to the CGI department.

And I have to say I wasn't disappointed at all.Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol.2 Offers so much thrills and an awesome cinematic experience, The action starts right from the opening scene and it doesn't end until the last 2 seconds of the film. The people behind the movie just knew how to not make the audience bored, and they succeeded at that.I have to say that 3D ticket here is worth the additional price, because honestly, if any movie deserved to be really watched in 3D it's this one,It adds so much depth to the scenes and makes the movie alive.The plot is interesting enough to keep you engaged and the pacing never really drags even with the movie's long duration.The soundtrack just fits right into its place and it really helped the background quality, providing the best classic songs. The movie is also really humorous and I found it as funny as the first.Due to the movie's high budget, the scenery is Amazing! The movie feels like a very entertaining roller coaster, it was a joy and all the crowd were very pleased.In the end, Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol.2 Is a MUST-SEE for fans of the first one and a VERY ENJOYABLE ride for everyone else.

98,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Better Than The First GOTG!!!,"I have to admit that I really liked, but did not LOVE the first Guardians of the Galaxy film, so when I entered the local cineplex to check out Volume 2, I had lowered my expectations, figuring I'd find a film that was filled with ""sequel-itis"" and be just a step down from the previous film.Boy...was I wrong.I LOVED GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY, VOLUME 2.  This sequel succeeded in doing what a good sequel needs to do - take the premise, feel, characters and style of the first film and build on it.And build on it, it does.  Director James Gunn states that the first Guardians was about ""a family coming together"", and the 2nd movie is about ""a family staying together"" - and this is a family I want around and staying together.  Starting with the ""core 5"" - StarLord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldona), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel).  These are all welcome characters that grow from the first movie to the 2nd, each with a purpose in this film and with something important to do.  I enjoyed seeing them all again.  Special notice should be paid to Bautista, who's Drax left me somewhat cold in the first film.  Here he is a delight.  Add to this returning characters Yondu (Michael Rooker) and Nebula (Karen Gillan) as well as newcomers Mantis (Pom Klementieff),  Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki) and Ego (Kurt Russell) and you have an ensemble that is easy and fun to watch.At some point in the film, I thought to myself ""now, THIS is a comic book film!"" and I think it is because of the action and the visuals.  The action moves fast and furious all the while populating a Universe (literally) that is eye-popping and interesting to watch.  Director Gunn keeps things moving along, never staying too long in one place whilst avoiding the shaky-cam action.  I always knew where I was in an action scene, what the characters are working on or for and what the outcomes might be.  It is a refreshing change from the disorienting ""shaky-cam"" that the Bourne movies have wrought.And, of course, nothing can top the soundtrack.  The first film's ""Awesome Mix"" was a strong, joyous part of that movie.  ""Awesome Mix, Vol. 2"" picks right up where the first one left off.  The songs picked for this film did not disappoint.Nor did much of this film.  I enjoyed myself - and the antics of this gang - from start to finish, including the 5(!) extra scenes in the credits.Letter Grade:  A9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","[['Galaxy', 'film', 'the local cineplex', 'Volume', 'a film', 'a step', 'the previous film.Boy', 'GUARDIANS', 'THE GALAXY', 'VOLUME'], ['This sequel', 'a good sequel', 'the premise', 'feel', 'style', 'the first film', 'it.And build'], ['Director James Gunn', 'Guardians', 'a family', 'movie', 'a family', 'a family'], ['core', 'StarLord', 'Chris Pratt', 'Gamora', 'Zoe Saldona', 'Drax', 'Dave Bautista', 'Rocket Racoon', 'Bradley Cooper', 'Baby Groot', 'Vin Diesel'], ['the first movie', 'a purpose', 'this film', 'something'], [], ['Special notice', 'Bautista', 'Drax', 'the first film'], ['a delight'], ['Add', 'Yondu', 'Michael Rooker', 'Nebula', 'Karen Gillan', 'Mantis', 'Pom Klementieff', 'Ayesha', 'Elizabeth Debicki', 'Ego', 'Kurt Russell', 'an ensemble', 'fun', 'some point', 'the film', 'THIS', 'a comic book', 'film'], ['the action'], ['The action', 'the while', 'Universe'], ['Director Gunn', 'place', 'whilst', 'the shaky-cam action'], ['an action', 'scene', 'the outcomes'], ['change', 'Bourne', 'course', 'nothing', 'the soundtrack'], ['The first film', 'Awesome Mix', 'joyous part', 'that movie'], ['Awesome Mix', 'Vol'], [], ['this film', 'this film'], ['this gang', 'start'], ['the credits.Letter', 'Grade', 'A9', 'Bank']]","[['first Guardians', 'Galaxy film', 'local cineplex', 'Volume', 'expectations', 'film', 'step', 'previous film.Boy', 'GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY', 'VOLUME'], ['sequel', 'sequel needs', 'premise', 'feel', 'characters and style', 'first film', 'it.And build'], ['Director James Gunn', 'first Guardians', 'family', 'movie', 'family', 'family'], ['core', 'StarLord', 'Chris Pratt', 'Gamora', 'Zoe Saldona', 'Drax', 'Dave Bautista', 'Rocket Racoon', 'Bradley Cooper', 'Baby Groot', 'Vin Diesel'], ['welcome characters', 'first movie', 'purpose', 'film', 'something'], [], ['Special notice', 'Bautista', 'Drax', 'first film'], ['delight'], ['Add', 'characters Yondu', 'Michael Rooker', 'Nebula', 'Karen Gillan', 'newcomers Mantis', 'Pom Klementieff', 'Ayesha', 'Elizabeth Debicki', 'Ego', 'Kurt Russell', 'ensemble', 'fun', 'point', 'film', 'THIS', 'book film'], ['action', 'visuals'], ['action', 'while', 'Universe'], ['Director Gunn', 'things', 'place whilst', 'shaky-cam action'], ['action scene', 'characters', 'outcomes'], ['change', 'Bourne movies', 'course', 'nothing', 'soundtrack'], ['first film', 'Awesome Mix', 'joyous part', 'movie'], ['Awesome Mix', 'Vol'], ['picks'], ['songs', 'film', 'film'], ['antics', 'gang', 'start'], ['extra scenes', 'credits.Letter Grade', 'A9', 'stars', 'Bank']]"

102,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Still fun,"The best thing about Marvel is also the worst thing: They always try to outdo themselves with the next film in the MCU. Sometimes it really works like with this film, and Captain America 2 and 3, and sometimes it doesn't like with Iron Man 2 and Thor 2. But the advantage is they know how to keep making it better. They take fan's criticisms and complaints into account and try really hard to fix them. Such is the case with this film. Not that I had anything to complain about with part 1, but man, this definetely beats part 1 by a lot. Everything about this is better. The pacing, the story, the dialouge, the humor, and even the soundtrack. It manages to keep the style, spirit, and tone of everything we loved about the first film while also breaking new ground with it. It's very hard to make lightning strike twice, especially with a film with as weird a premise as Guardians of the Galaxy. By all accounts, the first film shouldn't have worked. Even more so the case with this film. Marvel has managed to do the impossible twice now. This is good, because it proves they're willing to take risks, but this is also bad, because now they'll be forced to outdo themselves every time, until eventually they'll be crushed by their own unattainable expectations. I'm very worried this will happen in the near future, especially as new films come out with new characters and new crossover films. Will we eventually be too greedy and want more and more and bigger and better each time until we're disappointed? I hope not. I know this isn't really a review of the movie, so much as it is about Marvel, but it's getting really had to keep this spoiler-free. Trust me, this is one film where you want to go in knowing as little as possible. Don't read the comics, don't use social media until you've seen the film.

103,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Open Mindedly Exploring the Chauvinistic Celestial Domain,"This story has a philosophically intriguing and imaginative theme. If a person lived forever and for millions of years, what would be his psychology. What if he is also able to manifest his physical body and his world through his thoughts. This movie presents a picture where this person becomes extremely egoistic. There is no 'she' to this 'him' and I think that's what went wrong with this guy.He creates a wonderful planet and then to get rid of his loneliness goes around looking for other life in the universe. He finds many women, makes love to them and plants his seed on every planet he went so that he could take over the universe. He is able to destroy other beings and planets. This makes him think he could just destroy them whenever he wanted and walk away from the crime scene. But his son proves him wrong.Although it is nowhere close, this story does remind of god the father and Jesus the son and another story where it all went biblical. So the son in the story realizes who is father is, and who his real daddy is, and the difference between the two.Another interesting aspect of the story was the relationship between two sisters. Gamora and Nebula who were brought up by an abusive parent. Gamora remained beautiful because of her sister's sacrifices. I like the part where Gamora realizes this fact and starts appreciating her sister. Nebula was at the verge of killing her sister because she felt she had had enough. Love renders us weak and sacrifice has its limits. But in the end honest communication works its magic. The importance of role of communication in personal relationships comes to forefront altogether.There are many other intriguing things like Yondu looking into Rocket's eyes and saying a magical phrase. Totally amazing movie. A must watch.","[['This story', 'imaginative theme'], ['a person', 'psychology'], ['physical body', 'world'], ['This movie', 'a picture', 'this person'], [""'she"", ""this 'him"", 'this guy.He', 'a wonderful planet', 'loneliness', 'other life', 'the universe'], ['love', 'seed', 'every planet', 'the universe'], [], ['the crime', 'scene'], ['son', 'this story', 'god', 'the father', 'Jesus', 'the son', 'another story'], ['the son', 'the story', 'father', 'real daddy', 'the difference', 'the two.Another', 'aspect', 'the story', 'the relationship'], ['Gamora', 'Nebula', 'an abusive parent'], ['Gamora', 'sister'], ['the part', 'Gamora', 'this fact', 'sister'], ['Nebula', 'the verge', 'sister'], ['Love', 'sacrifice'], ['the end', 'communication', 'magic'], ['The importance', 'role', 'communication', 'Yondu', 'Rocket', 'a magical phrase'], ['amazing movie'], []]","[['story', 'imaginative theme'], ['person', 'millions of years', 'psychology'], ['physical body', 'world', 'thoughts'], ['movie', 'picture', 'person'], [""'she"", ""'him"", 'guy.He', 'wonderful planet', 'loneliness', 'other life', 'universe'], ['many women', 'love', 'plants', 'seed', 'planet', 'universe'], ['other beings and planets'], ['crime scene'], ['son', 'story', 'god', 'father and Jesus', 'son', 'story'], ['son', 'story realizes', 'father', 'real daddy', 'difference', 'two.Another', 'aspect', 'story', 'relationship', 'sisters'], ['Gamora and Nebula', 'abusive parent'], ['Gamora', 'sister', 'sacrifices'], ['part', 'Gamora', 'fact', 'sister'], ['Nebula', 'verge', 'sister'], ['Love renders', 'sacrifice', 'limits'], ['end', 'communication', 'magic'], ['importance of role', 'communication', 'personal relationships', 'things like Yondu', 'Rocket', 'eyes', 'magical phrase'], ['amazing movie'], []]"
104,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"The best characters/action team in movies today makes ""Vol. 2"" hard not to enjoy","Marvel Studios and writer/director James Gunn proved with 2014's ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" that superhero movies don't need to feature familiar (usually white, male, special suit-wearing) characters saving Earth; they just need to be fun, dynamic and easy to relate to. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" doubles down on its investment in Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel) among others, and it pays off.It turns out great characters that have interesting, often-hilarious and sometimes even sentimental interactions with each other can cover up a plot lacking any kind of direction. The film doesn't have a story so much as a few inciting incidents that create complicated scenarios for the characters to navigate. So the best one-sentence plot description is: After completing a job for the snooty, gold- embalmed Sovereign race and ensuing complications, the Guardians discover the truth about Quill's parentage.Gunn sews the movie's story lines into the character dynamics. The Quill-Gamora unspoken romance, the difference in attitude between Quill and Rocket, the animosity between Gamora and Nebula (Karen Gillan) – whom they pick up as a prisoner from the Sovereign — in addition to the verbal sparring between everyone. It's enough, because the characters already won audiences over the first time, and those same audiences will come out of this film even more invested in them.Although Groot, especially in baby form, will have the most fans, Rocket in particular emerges as the Guardians' most fascinating character. This movie is so overrun by CGI, but he feels as real as any of the actors. The character also gets a wider range to work with and Cooper absolutely delivers. Bautista also gets to show even more comedic range as Drax, who becomes more multi-note than simply the proud warrior who doesn't understand figures of speech.The script is so funny, so clever and so focused on blissful sci-fi action moments colored by '70s and '80s music that the finer details of the story are immaterial. The entertainment value is through the roof from start to finish despite the ways the plot seems to lack the appropriate stakes. It survives joke to joke, song to song even when this pattern starts to become a little predictable.So this sequel succeeds in ways that good sequels succeed and struggles with the challenges most of these sequels face. Gunn and Marvel Studios have identified precisely what made the first movie great and bring it even more to the forefront, while the same old conundrum of what situations to put them in plagues this story. So the story takes the form of mostly arbitrary scenarios whose sole job is to set up the characters, humor and soundtrack for success. To evaluate the action sequences would also lose sight of what this movie is. The action isn't interesting; it's more about the character dynamics that play into it and the moments of levity. No moment articulates this better than the opening credit sequence, which features a camera exclusively following baby Groot dancing about as the other Guardians fight a giant space beast in the background. There's a beauty in the way the movie pulls itself away from the noise that so many action movies bombard audiences with, assuming we just can't get enough of it. But if the action is going to be kind of low-stakes like it is here, better to turn it into about something more than just action.If it was close before, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" beats out ""The Avengers"" for best super-team after this one. In fact, they're probably the best ensemble of characters in any action franchise in the modern era. Each of them brings something unique and consequential to the film. Blockbusters just aren't doing enough of that, and it makes the flaws of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" effortless to overlook.~Steven CThanks for reading!

105,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Great sequel overall,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a great movie, and I would say better than the recent superhero movies. I'm afraid thought that the first movie set the expectations so high that is not crazy to doubt if this one was able to keep up.Visually is as good as the first one, the acting is on point and the soundtrack is dope. The plot is fine, although it falls under the ""knowing better the characters and realizing their sad and deep feelings"" cliché. It leaves me with the feeling that the first one was innovative and fresh, wherever this one just reused the formula.Apart from that, this is an entertaining and fun movie, and I would recommend it to anyone who is into superhero or science fiction movies.

106,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Our every year ritualistic going-to-the-theater-to-watch-a Marvel-movie finally begins.,"I feel like a drone. Every year Marvel comes out with its new set of movies and every year like drones we all go out to see them. And for this reason Marvel makes tons of $$$ without any quality improvement or originality, because as drones, we all just gobble it up. It's like we have been given a command: ""This year you will see the following movies and not hold them to any standard, kapeesh!!"" Marvel movie story lines have been declining while at the same time special effects and better actors getting hired has been increasing. Like how winning an Oscar now lands you a role in a super hero/big budget production rather than another artistic role: Brie Larson in Captain Marvel (and the horrible Kong), Lupita Nyong'o in Star Wars (ok, that's not Marvel, but still a huge franchise.), Jared Leto as the Joker (DC, I know), but you get the picture. This creates a conundrum in our heads: good acting, great special effects, bad story writing, so, hmmmm.......does this mean that I liked it? Should I go with the flow and say I liked it, because critics aren't gonna diss a movie that's sure to make $$$ and I don't wanna seem like a killjoy or shame myself in front of my firends? You know, I'll see the next Marvel movie and then decide.And so this year, the cycle begins with us giving our money to Guardians of the Galaxy V2. Expect nothing more than what the trailer has to offer. Or see the first one again and it'll be the same as seeing V2, you'll just save money. The story does advance with Kurt Russell starring as Starlord's dad. Kind of a rehash of ""No/Luke....I am your father."" It's good when they hire good actors. Make-up and special effects are great. But in all, I wouldn't use the words ""enjoyable"" or ""exciting."" I'll just say, ""Ritual completed, onto the next superhero movie.""Hey I'm a victim here nonetheless. I'm not criticizing people for seeing Guardians, as I also did, but I'm getting to get critical of us who every year, dish out our money for these superhero movies, which are in fact not becoming any better in quality, and studio execs thinking that they are creating masterpieces because of the gross $$$, hence thereforth making no extra effort to make a better movie. So see it, or stay at home and stare at the wall...it's up to you.

107,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"""Vol. 2 - The Awesome Mix""","There isn't much to say about 2017's ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" that probably hasn't been said already, so I'm just going to try to break it down into a few pointers/highlights.Writer/director James Gunn. I am continually impressed by this jokey, enthusiastic former Troma alumnus who has certainly come a long way SINCE his Troma days, and the gross-out horror of ""Slither"" (2006) and his first superhero effort, the black comedy ""Super"" (2010). You can tell that the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" series for Marvel are probably the films he's been wanting to make for the longest time.James Gunn, again. Gunn is a true smart-aleck, and his film is rife with witty one-liners and clever dialogue that shows that while his budgets have increased ten-fold, he still retains his smart-aleck sense of humor that characterized much of his earlier, smaller-budgeted work. And he makes his laughs, and the timing of those laughs, count.The cast - Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (pro wrestler Dave Bautista), Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper), and Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). What can I say? The central themes of this sequel are family, and the ties that bind. While Gunn's script kind of hits us over the head with this, it is clear that a cinematic family of sorts has been formed, amongst these hard-luck losers of petty crooks and fugitives-turned-mercenaries-for-hire, and they all appear to be having a blast in their roles - especially Chris Pratt, who before ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" was known primarily for his role on ""Parks and Recreation"" and has lost a considerable amount of weight, beefed up, and shaped himself into a capable leading man.The music. The film has a score by Tyler Bates, but its main soundtrack is comprised of old-school hits primarily from the 1970s, which gives ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" a kind of self-knowing retro-hipness that shows that while it's set in outer space and in another galaxy, its roots are firmly in the distant past, in far simpler times that Our Hero Star-Lord clings to desperately even as he embraces his new role as the leader of a mis-matched group of interstellar heroes.That's all that I really have to say about ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"" which is an even more Awesome Mix than the first.10/10","[['Galaxy Vol'], ['a few pointers/highlights.Writer/director', 'James Gunn'], ['this jokey', 'Troma', 'alumnus', 'a long way', 'SINCE', 'Troma', 'the gross-out horror', 'Slither', 'first superhero', 'effort', 'the black comedy', 'Super'], ['Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'series', 'Marvel', 'Gunn'], ['Gunn', 'a true smart-aleck', 'film', 'dialogue', 'smart-aleck sense', 'humor', 'smaller-budgeted work'], ['the timing', 'count.The', 'cast', 'Peter Quill/Star-Lord', 'Chris Pratt', 'Gamora', 'Zoe Saldana', 'Drax', 'pro wrestler', 'Dave Bautista', 'Rocket Raccoon', 'Bradley Cooper', 'Groot', 'Vin Diesel'], [], ['this sequel', 'family'], ['Gunn', 'script', 'kind', 'the head', 'a cinematic family', 'fugitives-turned-mercenaries-for-hire', 'a blast', 'Chris Pratt', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'role', 'Parks', 'Recreation', 'a considerable amount', 'weight', 'man.The music'], ['The film', 'a score', 'Tyler Bates', 'main soundtrack', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['a kind', 'self-knowing retro-hipness', 'outer space', 'another galaxy', 'the distant past', 'Hero Star-Lord', 'new role', 'the leader', 'a mis-matched group', 'interstellar heroes.That', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['Mix', 'the first.10/10']]","[['Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['pointers/highlights.Writer/director James Gunn'], ['jokey', 'Troma alumnus', 'way SINCE', 'Troma days', 'gross-out horror', 'Slither', 'superhero effort', 'black comedy', 'Super'], ['Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'series for Marvel', 'films', 'time.James Gunn'], ['Gunn', 'true smart-aleck', 'film', 'witty one-liners', 'dialogue', 'budgets', 'sense of humor', 'smaller-budgeted work'], ['laughs', 'timing', 'laughs', 'count.The cast', 'Peter Quill/Star-Lord', 'Chris Pratt', 'Gamora', 'Zoe Saldana', 'Drax', 'wrestler Dave Bautista', 'Rocket Raccoon', 'Bradley Cooper', 'Groot', 'Vin Diesel'], [], ['central themes', 'sequel', 'family', 'ties'], ['Gunn', 'script kind', 'hits', 'head', 'family of sorts', 'hard-luck losers', 'petty crooks and fugitives-turned-mercenaries-for-hire', 'blast', 'roles', 'Chris Pratt', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'role', 'Parks and Recreation', 'amount of weight', 'man.The music'], ['film', 'score by Tyler Bates', 'main soundtrack', 'old-school hits', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['kind', 'self-knowing retro-hipness', 'outer space', 'galaxy', 'roots', 'distant past', 'simpler times', 'Hero Star-Lord clings', 'new role', 'leader', 'mis-matched group', 'interstellar heroes.That', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['Awesome Mix', 'first.10/10']]"

There is a lot of problems with this movie but the biggest is that the guardians of the galaxy split up for most of the movie which easily weakens most of the movie. What worked most about the first movie was the whole team working together as a team and in this movie that happens at the beginning and the end of the movie and in my opinion those are the best parts of the movie, Yes there is enjoyment to be had in the middle of the movie but that is for only one story which is yondu rocket and baby groot's story but the rest of the stories are just not interesting sadly. But there is still some enjoyment to be had in this movie and the cast all once again give a great performance as there characters and the villain is pretty good and interesting.

Of course, Star Lord makes what he can do best, leading the group of a**holes.The cinematography, the stable and funny story, the brilliant colors, that James Gunn added to this movie are just fabulous! The comedy is totally on point. Action scenes are great. The music? Well you can listen the GOTG Vol.2 songs over and over again and they all works perfectly in the context of the movie.Phase 3 of MCU is very strong first with Civil War, then Doctor Strange and now Guardians doesn't disappoint at all.

115,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,A flashy production with no substance,"At the time of writing, there are only 7 out of 120 user reviewers that did not like the movie. I know I will receive a multitude of unhelpful votes for voicing my honest feedback about this movie. However, I hope that my feedback will be helpful for people who are able to judge a film in an objective manner so that they, at least, will be able to save their hard earned cash.Firstly, the main antagonist is a Marvel character that has been completely changed for this movie. It bears no background similarity to the character in the comics whatsoever. I understand that the Marvel movies are all about making a spin on the comic book story arcs, but this difference was far too large for me to accept.Whilst watching the movie, I had to ponder whether I had stepped into a Marvel Superhero version of ""Fast and Furious"". There was a continuous message that family is important and how the protagonists became who they were due to disenfranchised childhoods. Whilst this is a valid point, I do not feel that it belongs in a superhero action movie as it serves no purpose. Worse was when the message contradicted itself when we see Peter Quill betrayed by his Father. The clumsiness of this contradiction did nothing to alleviate the sickly sweet message that the movie was trying to convey. I get that James Gunn is trying to send out a message to the younger generation but I would think that kids go to watch a superhero movie for the action, and will not really appreciate or acknowledge the message that he is driving.Unlike the first movie, there was a distinct lack of character focus and their abilities. It could easily have been an action movie without superheroes. In fact, the movie seemed to be focused on two characters when it came to showcasing their abilities. One of these had a sequence that was inspired by the Quicksilver scenes in the X-Men movies. The other was extremely underwhelming and was defeated far too incredibly when you consider the differences in age and experiences. None of the characters were interesting with the exception of Nebula and Mantis. However, Pom Klementieff played her role like a stuttering female cyborg that I even thought the role was played by an East Asian actress before I checked the cast members. The actors paid to play the new characters were miscast in my opinion. Sylvester Stallone's performance reminded me of his Judge Dredd and not in a good way.It was clear that the popular factors in the first movie were taken and overdone in the second movie. Drax was made to look like a dumb fool once again but even more than in the first movie. While the CGI effects were good, the cuteness factor of Baby Groot served only to market the movie to kids and geek girls, and to rake in merchandise profit. There was also constant mention and focus on the cassette mix which was totally unnecessary (again, for merchandise promotion).With the exception of Captain America and the first two Avengers and Thor movies, why do the Marvel movies have to be over-saturated with humor? It's one thing to market the movies to a wider audience but it's totally another thing when it's taken too far, and the humor becomes so clichéd.","[['the time', 'writing', 'user', 'the movie'], ['a multitude', 'feedback', 'this movie'], ['feedback', 'a film', 'an objective manner', 'the main antagonist', 'Marvel', 'character', 'this movie'], ['no background', 'similarity', 'the character', 'whatsoever'], ['Marvel', 'a spin', 'the comic book', 'story', 'arcs', 'this difference', 'the movie', 'Marvel Superhero', 'version', 'Fast', 'Furious'], ['a continuous message', 'family'], ['a valid point', 'a superhero action', 'movie', 'no purpose'], ['the message', 'Peter Quill', 'Father'], ['The clumsiness', 'this contradiction', 'nothing', 'the sickly sweet message', 'the movie'], ['James Gunn', 'a message', 'generation', 'a superhero', 'movie', 'the action', 'the message', 'the first movie', 'a distinct lack', 'character', 'focus'], ['an action', 'movie'], ['fact', 'the movie'], ['a sequence', 'Quicksilver'], ['age'], ['None', 'the exception', 'Nebula', 'Mantis'], ['Pom Klementieff', 'role', 'female cyborg', 'the role', 'East', 'Asian actress', 'the cast'], ['opinion'], ['Sylvester Stallone', 'performance', 'Judge Dredd', 'a good way.It', 'the first movie', 'the second movie'], ['Drax', 'a dumb fool', 'the first movie'], ['CGI', 'the cuteness factor', 'Baby Groot', 'market', 'the movie', 'merchandise', 'profit'], ['constant mention', 'focus', 'the cassette', 'mix', 'merchandise', 'promotion', 'the exception', 'Captain America', 'Thor', 'Marvel', 'humor'], ['thing', 'market', 'a wider', 'audience', 'another thing', 'the humor']]","[['time of writing', 'user reviewers', 'movie'], ['multitude', 'unhelpful votes', 'feedback', 'movie'], ['feedback', 'people', 'film', 'objective manner', 'main antagonist', 'Marvel character', 'movie'], ['background similarity', 'character', 'comics whatsoever'], ['Marvel movies', 'spin', 'book story arcs', 'difference', 'movie', 'Marvel Superhero version', 'Fast and Furious'], ['message that family', 'protagonists', 'disenfranchised childhoods'], ['valid point', 'action movie', 'purpose'], ['message', 'Peter Quill', 'Father'], ['clumsiness', 'contradiction', 'nothing', 'sickly sweet message', 'movie'], ['James Gunn', 'message', 'generation', 'kids', 'superhero movie', 'action', 'message', 'first movie', 'lack of character focus', 'abilities'], ['action movie', 'superheroes'], ['fact', 'movie', 'characters', 'abilities'], ['sequence', 'Quicksilver scenes', 'X-Men movies'], ['differences in age', 'experiences'], ['None', 'characters', 'exception of Nebula', 'Mantis'], ['Pom Klementieff', 'role', 'female cyborg', 'role', 'East', 'Asian actress', 'cast members'], ['actors', 'new characters', 'opinion'], ['Sylvester Stallone', 'performance', 'Judge Dredd', 'good way.It', 'popular factors', 'first movie', 'second movie'], ['Drax', 'dumb fool', 'first movie'], ['CGI effects', 'factor of Baby Groot', 'market', 'movie', 'kids', 'geek girls', 'merchandise profit'], ['constant mention and focus', 'cassette mix', 'merchandise promotion', 'exception of Captain America', 'Avengers', 'Thor movies', 'Marvel movies', 'humor'], ['thing', 'market', 'movies', 'wider audience', 'thing', 'humor']]"
116,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,This movie is a joyous experience. Guaranteed to raise your mood!,"James Gunn is clearly a fan of the work, and his love for the material shows through out the movie. Such a weird and bizarre universe so beautifully adapted to the screen.This time around, part2 concentrates more on character development rather than being a plot driven movie. It concentrates on building the team dynamics and their relationships with each other. This enriches the movie's universe and is a decision with long term considerations for the series. Even if you miss out on the amount of plot, you will be easily distracted by the great humor. The jokes are well written through out the running time. I haven't had so many laughs in a movie since Deadpool.The plot is well written and the extra character development time raises the stakes and our attachment to the characters during action scenes. The actions scenes are visually incredible, in fact the entire universe is colorful and beautiful to behold.I had a blast watching this movie, and I think you will too.","[['James Gunn', 'a fan', 'the work', 'love', 'the material', 'the movie'], ['a weird', 'bizarre universe', 'the screen.This time', 'character', 'development', 'a plot', 'movie'], ['the team'], ['the movie', 'universe', 'a decision', 'long term', 'the series'], ['the amount', 'plot', 'the great humor'], ['the running time'], ['a movie', 'Deadpool.The', 'plot', 'the extra character', 'development', 'time', 'attachment', 'action'], ['fact', 'the entire universe', 'a blast', 'this movie']]","[['James Gunn', 'fan', 'work', 'love', 'material', 'movie'], ['weird', 'bizarre universe', 'screen.This time', 'concentrates', 'character development', 'plot', 'movie'], ['team dynamics', 'relationships'], ['movie', 'universe', 'decision', 'term considerations', 'series'], ['amount of plot', 'great humor'], ['jokes', 'running time'], ['many laughs', 'movie since Deadpool.The plot', 'character development time', 'stakes', 'attachment', 'characters during action scenes'], ['actions scenes', 'fact', 'entire universe', 'blast', 'movie']]"

Star-Lord himself, while still central to the ""plot"", seems strangely impersonal, dutifully reacting to events around him rather than guiding the action.

119,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Family lesson from space pirates,"When the first Guardians of Galaxy ended with high note, specifically with ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"", I was thoroughly blown away. Volume 2 is just a tad shy from that magical moment, yet it's an entertaining barrage of visual, music and humor of its own right. This time the space odyssey shines unexpectedly bright from the excellent supporting characters and their openly dysfunctional relationships while keeping the core charm from the original.The main story follows Quill and his newfound father Ego (Kurt Russell). It's a self-discovery and family ties plot device that for most parts work well enough, but it does feel too safe and follows the same footsteps of other Marvel movies. This tends to veer into the realm of godhood and while it possesses a few twists, the sense of novelty is reduced from the first movie.Still, it's not by any means a bad showing and luckily, the rest of the crew more than perform beyond their call of duty. Yondu (Michael Rooker) is a rock star of Mary Poppins' caliber. Not only he has one of the best action scenes in Marvel universe with the flying arrow, his character brings scruffy emotional depth as he interacts with Rocket and ultimately Quill.Nebula (Karen Gillan) has a very intense love-hate relationship with Gamora (Zoe Saldana). The two trades bullets and blows almost every time they meet. Nebula is much darker than the rest of the characters, a contrast the movie doesn't shy away from. The elegant part of this unhinged mentality is how her emotions are seeping through her metallic visage, just barely enough. It's, in an odd way, humanize both sisters exquisitely.Humor is abundance, tightly woven in even the direst situation. If you come for childish antic your adult self is trying to suppress, this will be nothing less than a gleeful escapade. The use of humor is especially useful in introducing a few more characters while expanding on what already a diverse cast. Nothing charms the audience better than characters that can make them giggle and smile, and in Volume 2 that's practically everyone.Volume 2 is visually more colorful than the original, taking advantage of the setting as well as robust action sequences. The first tracing shot alone makes it clear that this is smoother experience even in chaotic world the characters often find themselves into. Retro music makes an expected return, production knows the power of the soundtracks, thus trying to fit them into the story. This should never change.Imagine a moving painting of faraway world, serenaded by song from decades ago, where all the residents are partially broken inside and partially juvenile, yet manage to be so fricking lovable.

The highlights of the film are the performances & Baby Groot, of course. Chris Pratt is spectacular as Peter Quill/Star-Lord. Pratt expands on his character, adding more depth to his portrayal of Quill. Zoe Saldana is brilliant as Gamora. Saldana also explores new avenues of her character.

125,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Gave this one some thought,"I had originally not made it past 15 minutes in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) before walking out because of too many clichés at once (eg classics used in soundtrack, dance while you work, the choreographed fight scenes, precise long shots like ""throwing a dagger 30 feet, hitting, and knocking an orb out of someone's hand as the ran away"".) and given it a 1.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) coming out prompted me to see them both and it was almost as hard to get through the first one again, but, I enjoyed it. ""I am Groot"" was wearing thin then came the credit scenes.Then I started Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) and more of the same kind of initial revulsion with the opening scene. But, then, in short, I concluded that these movies shouldn't be judged harshly as I've seen almost all the classics and some turkeys. Sure, GOTG 1 and 2 has elements of both, and a few clichés, but, with so many movies coming out of Hollywood, there's going to be some repetition and imitation.This movie gives Disney storytelling image a much need boost with the help of current and not so current culture. Sure, I don't like most comic book movies but, this one makes the short list of ones I really do like. I even upped my GOTG (2014) rating from 1 to 8.","[['Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'soundtrack', 'dance', 'the choreographed fight', 'a dagger', 'hitting', 'an orb', 'someone', 'hand', 'the ran'], ['Galaxy Vol'], ['the first one'], ['Groot', 'the credit', 'scenes.Then', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['the same kind', 'initial revulsion', 'the opening', 'scene'], [], ['GOTG', 'a few clichés', 'Hollywood', 'some repetition', 'imitation.This movie', 'Disney', 'image', 'need', 'boost', 'the help', 'current culture'], ['comic book', 'the short list'], ['GOTG', 'rating']]","[['minutes in Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'many clichés', 'eg classics', 'soundtrack', 'dance', 'fight scenes', 'long shots', 'dagger', 'feet', 'hitting', 'orb out of someone', 'hand', 'ran'], ['Galaxy Vol'], ['first one'], ['Groot', 'credit scenes.Then', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['same kind', 'initial revulsion', 'opening scene'], ['movies', 'classics', 'turkeys'], ['GOTG', 'elements', 'few clichés', 'many movies', 'Hollywood', 'repetition', 'imitation.This movie', 'Disney', 'image', 'need boost', 'help', 'current culture'], ['book movies', 'list of ones'], ['GOTG', 'rating']]"
126,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,So let down by this movie.,"So let down by this movie. Rooker and Cooper were probably the best thing to come out of this film, and the only real comic relief came from Bautista and Klementieff's characters. Other than that, Guardians was just a mixed bag for me. I really wanted to like it, but the forced comedic moments, poor plot design, and mediocre characters and performances just left me feeling pretty dull about this film. In the end, I decided to give Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 an ""Alright"" on theVade Review Bar or a 5 out of 10. This film had so much potential, but ended being a giant let down. I knew from the moment that they green lit this movie after the initial one's success that it would never live up to its expectations.

127,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Gunn's weapon is already loaded with happiness.,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 introduces Baby Groot, a collectible figurine that's been brought to life. With exacting awareness and only slight edge of shame, the movie deploys its newfound mascot whenever the movie needs a boost. His minuscule smiles are irresistible, but his miniature scowls are just as winning. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is as reminiscent of the Fast & Furious franchise as it is the first film. They're a ragtag group of former criminals who've found themselves semi-accidentally on the side of saving the day. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 plays like a grand version of the sort of sitcom episode in which it looks like someone might leave the show, and then of course they do not.Testing the strength of the Guardians' connections would come across as more meaningful if it felt like they'd actually spent enough time together. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 attempts to tell a funny, heartfelt story about identity, loneliness, and belonging by way of a planet that has a face. Chris Pratt's reliably charismatic, but he's coasting on his appeal in this installment. Gamora, too, feels like she's in stasis, in both her not-quite-romance with Quill and her combative relationship with her sister Nebula.","[['Galaxy Vol'], ['Baby Groot', 'a collectible figurine', 'life'], ['awareness', 'slight edge', 'shame', 'the movie', 'newfound mascot', 'the movie', 'a boost'], ['minuscule', 'miniature', 'scowls'], ['Galaxy Vol'], ['reminiscent', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'franchise', 'the first film'], ['a ragtag group', 'the side', 'the day'], ['Galaxy Vol'], ['a grand version', 'the sort', 'sitcom', 'episode', 'someone', 'the show', 'course', 'the strength', 'Guardians', 'enough time'], ['Galaxy Vol'], ['a funny', 'story', 'identity', 'loneliness', 'belonging', 'way', 'a planet', 'a face'], ['Chris Pratt', 'appeal', 'this installment'], ['Gamora', 'stasis', 'not-quite-romance', 'Quill', 'combative relationship', 'Nebula']]","[['Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['introduces Baby Groot', 'collectible figurine', 'life'], ['awareness', 'edge of shame', 'movie', 'newfound mascot', 'movie', 'boost'], ['minuscule smiles', 'miniature scowls'], ['Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['reminiscent', 'Fast', 'Furious franchise', 'first film'], ['ragtag group', 'former criminals', 'side', 'day'], ['Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['plays', 'grand version', 'sort of sitcom episode', 'someone', 'show', 'course', 'strength', 'Guardians', 'connections', 'enough time'], ['Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['attempts', 'funny', 'story about identity', 'loneliness', 'belonging by way', 'planet', 'face'], ['Chris Pratt', 'appeal', 'installment'], ['Gamora', 'feels', 'stasis', 'not-quite-romance with Quill', 'combative relationship', 'sister Nebula']]"

134,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Not as good as the first but still very enjoyable,"Yeah, I said what I had to say in the subject line. I have a question about this movie. After the Guardians ship crash lands on Berhart, (prob spelling that wrong) Quill and Gamora have a private talk with one another where Gamora brings up the David Hasselhoff story that Quill told her someone before when he was drunk. The two were by themselves with nobody around at all. HOWEVER, later on in the movie when Quill realizes that Ego killed his Mother and knows what Ego's plan is, he attacks Ego. When Ego recovers, he changes his ""human form"" to David Hasselhoff. How the hell did he know to change himself to look like the Hoff!?!?!? This means that he somehow heard the private conversation between Quill and Gamora or just blindly guessed; and I HIGHLY DOUBT that Ego just guessed that. It's a small nit-pick but it does kinda bother me lol. Btw, does anybody have an explanation for this???Also, when Quill, Gamora and Drax are about to go with Ego and Mantis to his planet (aka himself? lol) Rocket is seen spraying the wreckage of the ship with this gun looking thing and the all the wires and metal are just randomly reappearing! Rocket is creating matter out of NOTHING! WTF is that!?!?!? That's insane! Am I the ONLY one fascinated with this???... and the fact that he only uses it the one time and for nothing else is a waste. Can it just repair machinery that wad already there or can he just make any kind of machinery just randomly show up or off thin air???

135,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Best Marvel Flick to Date,"Being its own universe away from the comics (as has always been) I went into this already knowing to expect some things I've known and loved since childhood reading comics, as well as surprising things that were and are new to the MCU.

136,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 Continues the Great Run of Marvel's Most Unconventional Team,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* We briefly join Meredith Quill (Laura Haddock) as she's having a joyride with her boyfriend Ego (a CG version of Kurt Russell). They pull in at a Dairy Queen but Ego takes her down the hill behind it to show here an extraterrestrial flower he's planted in the ground. They hug and Meredith remarks how she fell in love with a spaceman.A lot is expected from this movie. When you serve up an excellent and memorable movie the first time around, you not only have to meet that expectation but surpass it. James Gunn and the crew had an enormous amount of pressure and I think they expanded on the Guardians universe about as well as they could have. This movie is even more impressive visually, the colours explode around the characters. They create an even more vibrant and fun galaxy to exist in. The makeup is just as good if not better. I love the fact that they did the makeup practically on characters like Yondu, Drax, Gamora, Ayesha and Nebula; it just looks better with how much CGI we're getting nowadays. They also travel to new and interesting environments and it's good they weren't content just to recycle the CGI locations. I think this is an even better looking movie than the first one and considering the first one was no slouch in that department, that's high praise.The first Guardians really launched a few careers besides Gunn as a blockbuster filmmaker. Chris Pratt took a risk doing the first one and it payed off handsomely. He's consistent as Peter Quill and continues doing excellent work. Zoe's a sci-fi vet and she gets a more complete arc to work with here. She never gets her due and she's good here. Dave Bautista as Drax was even funnier and he continues to grow as an actor. Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper lend some more solid voice work. Several supporting characters get bigger chunks of screen time. Michael Rooker shines as Yondu, Karen Gillian gives Nebula some more dimension and I liked that Sean Gunn had a bigger role. Kurt Russell was perfect and he stole the show for me. He sells his emotional beats as Ego and you want to believe in his growing relationship with Peter. Pom Klementieff was decent even if I was kind of so-so on her character and I liked Elizabeth Debicki a lot. She's an underrated actress and she's pretty versatile.I think the only real weakness in the first movie is that Ronan makes for a forgettable villain. It wasn't Lee Pace's fault, it just seems to be a weakness that most of the Marvel movies share. Guardians Vol. 2 obscures the major threat to our heroes for a lot longer in the movie than it normally takes. I had an inkling on who would step forward but I think the movie did a really great job of creating a well rounded character to put in that spot. They develop a strong and personal relationship with one of the Guardians and you want to believe that they're going to be best friends forever. Even though if you pay attention, you can see the bread crumbs being dropped. So Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 even pulled off a rare feat for Marvel, an excellent villain to match up against the hero.This movie excels at being funny and it has some very emotional moments. The only real criticism of this movie that I have (other than comparing it to the first one) is that some of the moments feel a little forced. They make a concerted effort to give each of the characters their proper time and normally that's a good thing. But I felt like the movie was a little pushy in getting some of the emotional beats across. I don't want to come across as a nit-picker but they seemed less organic and a little overstuffed because everyone had to have a character arc. Perfect balance is hard to achieve and while this movie didn't fail, it didn't perfect it either.Guardians of the Galaxy was not only one of the best Marvel entries of the past couple of years but one of the best of Marvel's complete run as a movie production company. It completely blew me away, I love sci-fi adventure and while it fit in the larger Marvel cinematic universe, the movie wasn't afraid to deliver something off-beat and fresh. It gave us new Marvel characters that were different and took us to new places that we wouldn't see in other Marvel films. It was extremely funny but it had the plot and characters to back it up. I'm praising the first entry so thoroughly because one of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 unfortunate short-comings is that it doesn't come across as being as fresh or as inventive. It's not really fair because once you've already been introduced to something, you can't be re-introduced to it. So this movie really needed to do something amazing to replicate that feeling and while it more than justified itself as a sequel, I can't put it on the first one's level. It shored up certain minor short-comings from the first entry (delivering a genuinely memorable villain and adding interesting character development across the board) but it didn't hit that high benchmark. I still really dug it though, it would be more of an 8.5/10 but I don't feel bad rounding it up to a 9.","[['Minor Spoilers Ahead', 'Meredith Quill', 'Laura Haddock', 'a joyride', 'boyfriend', 'Ego', 'CG', 'version', 'Kurt Russell'], ['Dairy Queen', 'Ego', 'the hill', 'an extraterrestrial flower', 'the ground'], ['Meredith', 'love', 'a spaceman.A', 'lot', 'this movie'], ['an excellent', 'memorable movie', 'the first time', 'that expectation', 'surpass'], ['James Gunn', 'the crew', 'an enormous amount', 'pressure'], ['This movie'], ['fun galaxy'], ['The makeup'], ['the fact', 'the makeup', 'Yondu', 'Drax', 'Gamora', 'Ayesha', 'Nebula', 'CGI'], ['CGI'], ['movie', 'the first one', 'that department', 'high praise.The', 'Gunn', 'a blockbuster', 'filmmaker'], ['Chris Pratt', 'a risk'], ['Peter Quill', 'excellent work'], ['Zoe', 'a sci-fi vet', 'complete arc'], [], ['Dave Bautista', 'Drax', 'an actor'], ['Vin Diesel', 'Bradley Cooper', 'solid voice', 'work'], ['screen time'], ['Michael Rooker', 'Yondu', 'Karen Gillian', 'Nebula', 'dimension', 'Sean Gunn', 'role'], ['Kurt Russell', 'the show'], ['Ego', 'relationship', 'Peter'], ['Pom Klementieff', 'kind', 'so-so', 'character', 'Elizabeth Debicki', 'a lot'], ['an underrated actress', 'the only real weakness', 'the first movie', 'Ronan', 'a forgettable villain'], ['Lee Pace', 'fault', 'a weakness', 'Marvel', 'share'], ['Vol'], ['the major threat', 'a lot', 'the movie'], ['an inkling', 'the movie', 'great job', 'a well', 'rounded character', 'that spot'], ['personal relationship'], ['attention', 'the bread', 'crumbs'], ['Galaxy Vol'], ['a rare feat', 'Marvel', 'an excellent villain', 'the hero.This movie'], ['The only real criticism', 'this movie', 'the first one'], ['a concerted effort', 'proper time', 'a good thing'], ['the movie', 'a little pushy'], ['a nit-picker', 'a little overstuffed', 'everyone', 'a character', 'arc'], ['Perfect balance', 'this movie', 'Galaxy', 'the past couple', 'Marvel', 'complete run', 'a movie', 'production', 'company'], ['sci-fi adventure', 'Marvel', 'cinematic universe', 'the movie', 'something'], ['Marvel', 'Marvel'], ['the plot'], ['the first entry', 'Galaxy Vol'], [], ['something'], ['this movie', 'something', 'feeling', 'a sequel', 'the first one', 'level'], ['the first entry', 'memorable villain', 'interesting character', 'development', 'the board', 'that high benchmark'], []]","[['* Minor Spoilers Ahead', 'Meredith Quill', 'Laura Haddock', 'joyride', 'boyfriend Ego', 'CG version', 'Kurt Russell'], ['Dairy Queen', 'Ego', 'hill', 'extraterrestrial flower', 'ground'], ['Meredith remarks', 'love', 'spaceman.A lot', 'movie'], ['excellent', 'memorable movie', 'first time', 'expectation but surpass'], ['James Gunn', 'crew', 'amount of pressure', 'Guardians'], ['movie', 'colours', 'characters'], ['fun galaxy'], ['makeup'], ['fact', 'makeup', 'characters like Yondu', 'Drax', 'Gamora', 'Ayesha and Nebula', 'much CGI', 'nowadays'], ['interesting environments', 'CGI locations'], ['movie', 'first one', 'department', 'high praise.The', 'Guardians', 'few careers', 'Gunn', 'blockbuster filmmaker'], ['Chris Pratt', 'risk'], ['Peter Quill', 'excellent work'], ['Zoe', 'sci-fi vet', 'complete arc'], [], ['Dave Bautista', 'Drax', 'actor'], ['Vin Diesel', 'Bradley Cooper', 'voice work'], ['characters', 'chunks', 'screen time'], ['Michael Rooker', 'Yondu', 'Karen Gillian', 'Nebula', 'dimension', 'Sean Gunn', 'role'], ['Kurt Russell', 'show'], ['beats as Ego', 'relationship with Peter'], ['Pom Klementieff', 'kind of so-so', 'character', 'Elizabeth Debicki', 'lot'], ['underrated actress', 'only real weakness', 'first movie', 'Ronan', 'forgettable villain'], ['Lee Pace', 'fault', 'weakness', 'Marvel movies share'], ['Guardians Vol'], ['major threat', 'heroes', 'lot', 'movie'], ['inkling', 'movie', 'great job', 'well', 'rounded character', 'spot'], ['personal relationship', 'Guardians', 'friends'], ['attention', 'bread crumbs'], ['Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['feat for Marvel', 'excellent villain', 'movie excels', 'emotional moments'], ['only real criticism', 'movie', 'first one', 'moments'], ['concerted effort', 'characters', 'proper time', 'good thing'], ['movie', 'little pushy', 'emotional beats'], ['nit-picker', 'overstuffed because everyone', 'character arc'], ['Perfect balance', 'movie', 'Galaxy', 'Marvel entries', 'couple of years', 'Marvel', 'complete run', 'movie production company'], ['sci-fi adventure', 'Marvel', 'cinematic universe', 'movie', 'something'], ['Marvel characters', 'new places', 'Marvel films'], ['plot and characters'], ['first entry', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['unfortunate short-comings'], ['something'], ['movie', 'something', 'feeling', 'sequel', 'first one', 'level'], ['certain minor short-comings', 'first entry', 'memorable villain', 'character development', 'board', 'high benchmark'], []]"

140,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"A Movie Filled with ""Whys?""","The Guardians of the Galaxy 2 tried to one-up the first movie in many ways, which is great. It also failed to one-up the first movie in each of those ways, which is less great.I don't want to seem like I am simply dumping all over this movie because I genuinely enjoyed parts of it. To avoid that, I will discuss some things that I didn't like, followed by some things that I liked, and then I will end with a few things that I didn't like and give a brief recap. Sound good? Cool. Here we go.The Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is funny, but not as funny as the first one. The second one may have had more independent jokes that made me laugh, but the jokes didn't fit naturally the way they did in the first movie. I imagine I could probably pluck jokes from a given scene in Guardians 2 and place them in other scenes and they it wouldn't really change anything. They already felt out of place, so they wouldn't feel any more out of place if inserted elsewhere. Most of the jokes in Guardians 2 halted scenes in an awkward way that was especially noticeable when they failed to get a laugh. That wasn't the case in Guardians 1.The star of the movie, since Pratt was stolen by his dad, was Dave Bautista playing Drax. His laugh alone should win him some kind of award. He also had many of the movies best jokes and began a fun, if not unusual, romance with a new ""disgusting bug lady,"" as he would call her. Shouts to Drax. He's the movie MVP. Sorry, Baby Groot. You're still adorable.Sequels are tricky. They need to walk a fine line between remaining true to the original without falling into the trap of cheaply ripping it off. Guardians 2 was not quite sure how to do that. It tried to add additional layers to the story by making the audience feel for the characters. It tried to make the one-dimensional characters deep and sympathetic. This isn't a terrible idea, but it resulted about 50 too many mentions of ""family"" in the cheesy heartfelt conversations and an unnecessary overarching theme of daddy issues. Missteps like this make Guardians 1 ostensibly superior.I know I shouldn't dissect this movie so thoroughly. It's not meant for that. Yet I couldn't help noticing the movie's flaws.If you are looking for a zany, fun time at the theaters involving little to no thought, this movie may work for you. If you plan on asking questions or thinking about the plot, you should probably watch something else.","[['Galaxy', 'the first movie'], ['the first movie', 'this movie'], ['a brief recap'], [], ['Cool'], ['Galaxy', 'the first one'], ['The second one', 'the way', 'the first movie'], ['scene', 'Guardians', 'anything'], ['place', 'place'], ['Guardians', 'an awkward way', 'a laugh'], ['the case', 'Guardians', 'star', 'the movie', 'Pratt', 'dad', 'Dave Bautista', 'Drax'], ['laugh', 'some kind', 'award'], ['a fun', 'romance', 'bug', 'lady'], ['Drax'], ['the movie', 'MVP'], ['Sorry', 'Baby Groot'], [], ['a fine line', 'the trap', 'cheaply'], [], ['the story', 'the audience', 'feel'], [], ['a terrible idea', 'family', 'the cheesy', 'heartfelt', 'theme'], ['this make', 'superior.I', 'this movie'], [], ['the movie', 'flaws.If', 'a zany', 'fun time', 'no thought', 'this movie'], ['the plot', 'something']]","[['Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'first movie', 'many ways'], ['first movie', 'ways', 'movie', 'parts'], ['things', 'things', 'few things', 'brief recap'], [], ['Cool'], ['Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'first one'], ['second one', 'independent jokes', 'jokes', 'way', 'first movie'], ['jokes', 'scene in Guardians', 'other scenes', 'anything'], ['place', 'place'], ['jokes in Guardians', 'scenes', 'awkward way', 'laugh'], ['case in Guardians', 'star', 'movie', 'Pratt', 'dad', 'Dave Bautista', 'Drax'], ['laugh', 'kind of award'], ['movies', 'jokes', 'fun', 'romance', 'bug lady'], ['Shouts', 'Drax'], ['movie MVP'], ['Sorry', 'Baby Groot'], ['adorable.Sequels'], ['fine line', 'trap of cheaply'], ['Guardians'], ['additional layers', 'story', 'audience feel', 'characters'], ['one-dimensional characters'], ['terrible idea', 'many mentions', 'family', 'cheesy heartfelt conversations', 'theme', 'daddy issues'], ['Missteps', 'make', 'superior.I', 'movie'], [], ['movie', 'flaws.If', 'zany', 'fun time', 'theaters', 'thought', 'movie'], ['questions', 'plot', 'something']]"
141,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Volume 2 and still going strong :D.,"In to the second installment of the Guardian of the Galaxy our team meets Peter's Father ,Ego,Yondu faces issues with his crew and everyone is for a lack of a better word a brick ,even Baby Groot ,which was beyond adorable and up and right hilarious. In general as a sequel was on part with the first film, thought not all the jokes were on point and the soundtrack wasn't so memorable as with the first one.Over all the film had amazing visuals ,excellent computer animation and ,in all that ,we got a in-depth look in to the psychology of each character. And it was done in a funny, enjoyable and ""normal"" way (we talking about a space film, with a talking raccoon, a living tree and gold aliens ,the term normal ,we have to take him with a grain of salt). To be more precise all the main characters (apart from Groot )face trauma due to their up bringing and this team ,these Guardians aren't just a team, is their closest to a family.But what I got of film is that all the misadventures of all the player in the film come out of their actions. They acted foolishly and got in to trouble, basically karma. And I can't forget the most outrageous Stan Lee cameo ever, it was funny to the point of tears.Over all I am unable to say more about the film since that would be to heavy of a spoiler and I don't want to spoil that flick for you, go watch in theaters as soon as possible.","[['the second installment', 'Guardian', 'Galaxy', 'team', 'Peter', 'Father', 'Ego', 'Yondu', 'crew', 'everyone', 'a lack', 'word', 'a brick', 'Baby Groot'], ['a sequel', 'part', 'the first film', 'point', 'the soundtrack', 'the first one.Over', 'the film', 'excellent computer', 'animation', 'a in-depth look', 'the psychology', 'each character'], ['a funny', 'way', 'a space', 'film', 'raccoon', 'a living', 'tree', 'gold', 'the term', 'a grain', 'salt'], ['Groot', 'face', 'trauma', 'bringing', 'this team', 'a team', 'closest', 'a family.But', 'film', 'the player', 'the film'], ['trouble'], ['Stan Lee', 'cameo', 'the point', 'the film', 'a spoiler', 'that flick', 'watch']]","[['second installment', 'Guardian', 'Galaxy', 'team', 'Peter', 'Father', 'Ego', 'Yondu', 'issues', 'crew and everyone', 'lack', 'word', 'brick', 'Baby Groot'], ['sequel', 'part', 'first film', 'jokes', 'point', 'soundtrack', 'first one.Over', 'film', 'amazing visuals', 'computer animation', 'in-depth look', 'psychology', 'character'], ['funny', 'way', 'space film', 'raccoon', 'living tree', 'gold aliens', 'term', 'grain of salt'], ['main characters', 'Groot', 'face trauma', 'bringing', 'team', 'Guardians', 'team', 'closest', 'family.But', 'film', 'misadventures', 'player', 'film', 'actions'], ['trouble'], ['Stan Lee cameo', 'point', 'film', 'spoiler', 'flick', 'watch in theaters']]"

Star-Lord, however, has the grandest daddy issues of all. Between Yondu, his surrogate father, and Ego, his real father, he's got his share of problems. The rest of his team have family issues as well, and director James Gunn manages to work on each of them. In the process, he deftly sidesteps the issues that have plagued previous MCU sequels, while also reminding us of the menace that is Thanos which lurks just off-screen despite not launching the plot of this film into a larger tie-in with the rest of the MCU.The movie is fun, funny, and whenever Baby Groot is around, simply adorable. The chemistry between the actors is obvious, and helps elevate the overall product even more.

146,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 Review,"Welcome to the guardians of the frickin' galaxy, and enter dancing baby Groot. The opening scene during the credits was super fun, and baby Groot is just so adorable. While not every character gets a great character arc there are several great moments for each character. Drax played by Dave Bautista provides most of the comic relief, when Groot and Rocket Racoon (Bradley Cooper) are not on screen. Some of the humor takes things a bit too far, but for the most part, the comedy has been up'd in this sequel. All of the Marvel movies have great visual effects and this one is no different. The opening scene with a young Kurt Russell looks very believable. The movie knows how to use color to great effect. The setting for the gold people, known as the Sovergn, looks spectacular, with the bright gold and bold blue and white backdrop. Considering the movie has lots of characters of all different colors, each of them seemed to stand out beautifully.Now, even though I like Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana's characters, Peter Quill and Gamora, the standout characters by far were Michael Rooker's, Yondu and Karen Gillan's, Nebula. Two characters I thought were ""okay"" in the first movie, get more backstory and character motivation in this movie. It humanizes them to make them sympathetic characters that can be redeemed. One thing that wasn't as good as the first movie is the use of music. The opening song with baby Groot dancing around was great, but some of the other songs seemed just there in the background and didn't add anything to the scene. Unlike the first movie where the songs would enhance the scenes, only a few moments in Vol.2 do that well. Without spoiling who the villain is, I will just say, this is one of the better villains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and vastly better than the first movie's villain, Ronan. I understand the villain's plan and completely believe that they believe in what they are doing. There were a couple of very well done and horrifying moments that are unsettling to make the audience hate the villain. The best thing is that the villain provides more than a physical threat but an emotional one as well. Also providing insight into the relationships between several of the other characters. Overall, I would say that I enjoy Vol.2 more than the first movie, but that does not mean that it is perfect or better. While the movie has enhanced certain characters, it also adds more to the plot and takes a too much time trying to bring the Guardians back together for the final battle. However, I really liked Kurt Russell's character, Ego, I love baby Groot and the best line of the movie is Yondu's, ""I'm Mary Poppins, ya'll!""

Up until Winter Soldier I enjoyed the movies, but I wasn't really blown away by any of them. Sure, most of them had some memorable scenes, but then I arrived at guardians of the galaxy, and it was such a breath of fresh air. The first part was already super enjoyable with good humor and stunning visuals, but the second one took the top spot for me. Everything from the characters and their struggles, the story, the music and again the absolute breathtaking visuals and bright colors is just top tier.

When it's discovered that Rocket secretly stole several batteries for himself, the Sovereign send a fleet of drones to attack the Guardians' ship, the Milano. Drax going at back of ship shooting enemy's little drones that's great action scene giving Bautista something to do more he is in the all film but in fist he hasn't got much action scenes to do but anyway he does a lot in this film. I Like that Action Scene a lot more it was fun, they crashed into some planet nearby planet, where Ego (Kurt Russell) character appears in all movie with along side with new character Mantis (Pom Klementieff) and single-handed destroys all the drones. After revealing himself as his father, Ego invites Quill accompanied by Gamora and Drax, to his home In Moments you have Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker) we all know he is Pain in butt in first film but in this they changed his character better in moment scene with Stakar Ogord / Starhawk (Sylvester Stallone) one of my Favorite Actors of all time. him and Michael Rooker Played each another Cliffhanger(1993) but in this film they both have scene together about A lifelong, high-ranking Ravager who has a history with Yondu In past with him and Starhawk sold him out he doesn't want him anymore. i am not going to share that detail what i liked about scene its strong performance i just really wish they got Sly & Michael in longer scene it's Strange because in my opinion Stallone doesn't suit for role for Guardians of Galaxy film not his type but he is their for paycheck he is not really in it maybe Director or writer's didn't give him much to do witch it's shame. About more to do and making more acting performance in film give sly to do more action alongside with Michael Rooker character i really wish that could happened. give Sly and Kurt acting again in this film they all played In One Film They Never Met Each Another Characters never did noting with them it would be cool if they scene with Sly and Kurt in this film have action fight scene or something or acting scene but anyway it doesn't happen. there were a lot of funny moments So you have many funny moments with Groot its so funny makes you laugh more. and this sequel i would say a lot more better not just because new characters or just because its new sequel all that it was just better and it was more fast Paced film it was Guardians are together the first film is great. idea of Michael Rooker Character more of good guy and he becomes character you hate in first film but in this you start to like him a lot great funny jokes makes you laugh out of you ass out of seat. there is something you should not miss towards at end of film there mid post-credit scenes and ending to it never miss something i never wanted to share. 10 out 10 its worth fun watching sequel of all of time i would say its a lot more better first film.","[['hell', 'sequel', 'film', 'the first film', 'i', 'the first film', 'i', 'big sequel', 'a lot', 'funny staff', 'film', 'film', 'a lot', 'action', 'a lot', 'film',

150,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Disappointment of the year,"The first Guardians was great. It was unexpected, fresh, funny, with exciting characters and a decent story. For the sequel they kept the characters, but the jokes were forced (I only had a few laughs), the characters, although they were the same, became much less likable, and there was hardly any story. It was boring, and after the first hour or so, I was eagerly waiting for the movie to end. While in the first film the old school music was a clever tool to create a unique atmosphere, in this one it quickly became tired, as the movie was too heavily relying on it. Also, they used waaaaay too much exposition. Almost everything you learn about the characters, their backstories and the plot itself, they tell you through dialogue. (That's poor writing.) One more thing that really bothered me (among many other things) was Sean Gunn. He is clearly not a good actor, but for some reason (probably because he's the director's brother) he got much more screen time than in the first film. And it didn't work. Just like most of the movie.3/10","[['Guardians'], ['a decent story'], ['the sequel', 'a few laughs', 'any story'], ['the first hour', 'the movie'], ['the first film', 'the old school', 'music', 'a clever tool', 'a unique', 'the movie'], ['much exposition'], ['everything', 'the plot', 'dialogue'], ['poor writing'], ['thing', 'Gunn'], ['a good actor', 'some reason', 'the director', 'brother', 'screen time', 'the first film'], ['work'], ['the movie.3/10']]","[['first Guardians'], ['exciting characters', 'decent story'], ['sequel', 'characters', 'jokes', 'few laughs', 'characters', 'story'], ['first hour', 'movie'], ['first film', 'school music', 'clever tool', 'unique', 'movie'], ['much exposition'], ['everything', 'characters', 'backstories', 'plot', 'dialogue'], ['poor writing'], ['thing', 'many other things', 'Sean Gunn'], ['good actor', 'reason', 'director', 'brother', 'screen time', 'first film'], ['work'], ['movie.3/10']]"
151,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Capsule Review: Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"If repetitive chase sequences, contrived colorful explosions at the end of every action sequence, and occasionally forced and isolated comedy are the only parameters that you judge a superhero movie in 2017 with, then Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 should be a collector's product. There's a lot of references in this film that demands you go back to Vol. 1 and also take a 50-hour pop culture lesson narrated by Stan Lee. The plot associated with Walkman-ambassador leader guardian Quill's parentage is a boring cliché and one that makes you puke, considering there are more grotesque beings and objects in the film. A sheer lack of novelty, the inability to improve the charm in the characters, and reckless usage of CGI majorly affects James Gunn's second major feature film that is gaudier than the film's obnoxious poster. Chris Pratt has begun to slightly annoy and if he maintains a similar air we'll have to turn to DC by the time these guardians create the next volume. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is an ordinary superhero film with lots of blabbering using advanced vocabulary and lots of flashes, lasers, flares, and plasma. It also has a gold-obsessed priestess awkwardly trying to get at the guardians for stealing a bunch of her Duracell batteries. Like this, there are many more mindless arcs, but I'm fairly content because Quill was finally introduced to Microsoft Zune, arguably one of the best music players to come out of the technology race.

152,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Will the price increase to save the galaxy for the second time?,"The inaugural chapter of the most irreverent galactic mercenaries from Marvel was a gigantic turning point in the path set by superhero movies. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" was one of the best — and completely fortuitous—proposals in 2014, a carefree sci-fi film that divorced in full from the general storyline that, by requirement, has to follow regarding the super longed final outcome called ""IW"". The massive success was mainly due to inexorable features as the different and unusual—at that time—humor types present in the characters, the visuals as artificial as extraordinary or a soundtrack based on the 80's Walkman, which were developed with ease on the three true foundations: Story (screenplay), actors (performances) and director (decisions). From all, that colorful and hilarious mix comes the expected ""Vol. 2 "", which remains stable in relation to the first one and satisfies the enormous expectation that was on the shoulders of the guardians.If the creative outbursts of the writer seemed eccentric in the first film by virtue of the composition of apparently nothing correlated tones and genres, in this one, James Gunn is fully unleashed from any impediment in a story of living planets, hybrids between deities and humans and allusions to Mary Poppins. The director preserves his characteristic flame innovating and relating exotic formulas even in the opening since later in the astonishing 80's introduction, the initial sequence ratifies a cosmic and comical aura almost equal to its the predecessor, orchestrated by multi-functional Gunn.Here, the triad of elements, that were as original as refreshing in the first installment, are strengthened, getting the same heart with a similar wrapper, it's really a continuation, not a clone. The most important pillar is the story, the plot around which the movie will have to be meant. Before it was about setting up a dysfunctional family, now, it's about being a dysfunctional family. With a general structure established, its writer, who is also a director, chooses to explore and clarify the past of his pieces, since due to its dazzling introduction was possibly a wide and amusing deepening of its roots. In addition, this study is applied to the introduction of new Guardians: Mantis, Yondu, and Nebula, who arrive to transform the quintet into an octet of light hearted fun, finding in them a new breath to irreverence of the core stars. Likewise, within that sea of fabulous inclusions, the scriptwriters insinuate and strengthen what they have been announcing for some time: Independent of the appearances in ""Infinity War"" or future movies, the story of the Guardians will have three films, nothing more, nothing less, however, the filmmaker has insinuated that although the official closing of the cycle of Stard-Lord and his gang ends with the longed for third one, we could see more movies, in the distant future, of the Guardians, but... Of who? With great feasibility may be referring to the ancestors of Gamora and GrootIt happens with very few motion pictures, ""Guardians"" is in that strange but thankful section. Even though humans will always get swept up in visuals, seeing is believing, James Gun's film, like its predecessor presents an authentic, nostalgic and a maddening musical compendium from the late 1970s/early 1980s, hits enhancing the scenes with regard to the seen ones in the universe. While ""Mr. Blue Sky"" by Electric Light Orchestra provides the best and most monumental opening for a Marvel movie,""The Chain"" by Fleetwood Mac orchestrates one of the most mind-blowing sequences that Phase 3 of the MCU has been able to set up, to this mix of yesteryear, we can add it a few songs that are right on target in the dramatic moments, which also make way for the best of Marvel. Do you want an appetizer? See the teaser trailer. Another extra? See the official trailer. But in case you are still overcome by doubts, another one? Delight yourself with the opening sequence. The pictures are sickeningly sweet like a visit to a candy shop, prevailing and vigorous like the guilty pleasure of entering the shop. The range of colors is phenomenal, and its application boosts greatly that feeling, moreover, the way to sort the components in the scene is beautiful, colorful; a harmony vis-à-vis with each character. However, they episodically fail in the well-known ""more is less"" proverb, even thought Ego's planet is paradisiacal, the screen is crowded of pigments and dizzying gadgets for the spectator, tarnishing the beauty of photography, from superhero world newcomer Henry Braham. It's worth highlighting the remarkable work in the editing room, that in addition to vivify scenes, produce mind-boggling IMAX and 3D screenings, that will leave you astounded. Also, it's meritorious to applaud the exact length of the film, those two hours and eighteen minutes don't feel unused at all.And Gunn keeps on to inscribe rules for upcoming superhero movie directors. The filmmaker concludes his feature film, his work, his son, his beloved in an intimate and melancholy way, producing a breath of hope and affliction at the same time, something that, at first glance, doesn't fit into the atmosphere of the story, but that after following the crazy adventures of our guardians for two hours feels phenomenally effective. A smile and a goodbye hurt more than hundreds of blows and Gunn has shown (also) to know how to handle it. He's a peculiar director, that has pros and cons like any other man—but more pros—, the priority for music, the character design, the importance of comedy and drama, the tidiness imposed on frames and a few hazards crossing their minds. It seems Marvel will continue at the service of the demands and ideas of this talented man and his squad of characters, demonstrating in this installment more of everything, duplicating what we liked about the first one, but giving it personality to a film as fun as tear-producing simultaneously.","[['The inaugural chapter', 'Marvel', 'a gigantic turning', 'point', 'the path', 'superhero'],

154,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Still retains most of the fun and action that made the original such a hit,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is the sequel to the 2014 film and the third entry into Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Based on the Marvel Comics characters, this film still retains most of the fun and action that made the original such a hit.A short time after the events of the first film, the Guardians of the Galaxy, lead by Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), are still travelling through space on their usual adventures. One day, after escaping from a barrage of enemies, the Guardians meet a mysterious man named Ego (Kurt Russell), who claims to be Peter's true father. Ego takes Peter to his homeworld, where he intends to live with and be a true father to him. However, the rest of the Guardians feel something doesn't seem right and investigate what Ego's true intentions really are.Filled to the brim with dry humour, great action, a catchy soundtrack, a funny Stan Lee cameo, and the rest of the Marvel film staples, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a worthy follow-up, although it does lack some of the freshness and surprise that was in the 2014 original. I particularly enjoyed the extended character development given to characters Drax (Dave Bautista) and Yondu (Michael Rooker). Once again, though, it is Vin Diesel as (Baby) Groot who steals the show in just about every scene he is in. As to be expected, there are some post-credits scenes to stay back for, five of them to be precise.I rate it 8/10","[['Galaxy Vol'], ['the sequel', 'film', 'the third entry', 'Phase', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe'], ['Marvel Comics', 'this film', 'the fun', 'action', 'a hit.A', 'short time', 'the first film', 'Galaxy', 'lead', 'Peter Quill/Star-Lord', 'Chris Pratt', 'space'], ['day', 'a barrage', 'Guardians', 'a mysterious man', 'Ego', 'Kurt Russell', 'Peter', 'true father'], ['Ego', 'Peter', 'homeworld', 'a true father'], ['the rest', 'something', 'Ego', 'the brim', 'dry humour', 'great action', 'a catchy', 'soundtrack', 'Stan Lee', 'cameo', 'the rest', 'Marvel', 'film', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['a worthy follow-up', 'the freshness', 'surprise'], ['the extended character', 'development', 'Drax', 'Dave Bautista', 'Yondu', 'Michael Rooker'], ['Vin Diesel', 'Baby', 'Groot', 'the show', 'every scene'], ['precise.I rate']]","[['Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['sequel', 'film', 'entry into Phase', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe'], ['Marvel Comics characters', 'film', 'fun and action', 'hit.A', 'short time', 'events', 'first film', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'lead by Peter Quill/Star-Lord', 'Chris Pratt', 'space', 'usual adventures'], ['day', 'barrage of enemies', 'Guardians', 'mysterious man', 'Ego', 'Kurt Russell', 'Peter', 'true father'], ['Ego', 'Peter', 'homeworld', 'true father'], ['rest', 'Guardians', 'something', 'Ego', 'true intentions', 'brim', 'dry humour', 'great action', 'catchy soundtrack', 'Stan Lee cameo', 'rest', 'Marvel film staples', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['worthy follow-up', 'freshness and surprise'], ['character development', 'characters Drax', 'Dave Bautista', 'Yondu', 'Michael Rooker'], ['Vin Diesel', 'Baby', 'Groot', 'show', 'scene'], ['post-credits scenes', 'precise.I rate']]"
155,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"""He May Have Been Your Father, Boy, But He Wasn't Your Daddy""","Picking up a few months after the first Guardians, Vol. 2 follows the Guardians of the Galaxy as they work to uncover Peter Quill's parentage while evading a race called the Sovereign. Meanwhile, Yondu's Ravagers are hunting the Guardians for a huge payday, and Yondu ends up working to save the Guardians from certain death. All of the main cast members from the first movie return, and they are joined by Kurt Russell as Ego, Pom Klementieff as Mantis, and Elizabeth Debicki as Ayesha.James Gunn wrote and directed this movie, so a lot of the credit for this movie's success goes to him. His irreverent-yet-still-emotionally-affecting style is perfect for guys like the Guardians. He manages to go deeper into the hero characters and flesh out their relationships with one another, while at the same time fleshing out the backstories of lesser-known characters like Nebula and Yondu.Kurt Russell is great as Ego, Peter's father. It's great to see his character fit right in alongside the goofy, comedic Guardians, and he always keeps you guessing as to what his real motivations are. Klementieff's Mantis, meanwhile, is a standout character; she's immediately likable and endearing, and she manages to develop a strong rapport with several of the veteran Guardians, especially Drax, who continues to get several funny lines and beats.The Gamora/Nebula sisterhood is also expanded on in this film. The sisters have a complicated history together due to their shared trauma at the hands of Thanos, and we begin to see what's driving each of them in their endeavors. Karen Gillan does a great job with more material, and Zoe Saldana makes Gamora a more complex character with her performance, too. This becomes crucial to understanding their dynamic with Thanos as that comes into play in Infinity War.Yondu's expanded role was probably the most welcome surprise for me. He's an egotistical jackass, but he turns out to be a pretty decent guy beneath the pirate suit and no-nonsense exterior. Michael Rooker does a great job with this new material, and he plays off of Chris Pratt really well. Speaking of which, Pratt really shines as Quill here. Quill's dealt with a lot of emotional trauma in his life, and it comes into play in a number of ways in this movie. That trauma beings to impact his relationships with several people, especially Gamora and Ego.Rocket Raccoon deserves to be praised as well. Rocket's CGI is just as flawless as it was in Vol. 1, and the character himself is fleshed out a little more. Rocket turns out to be fearful of intimacy due to past trauma of his own, and it makes his feuding with Quill more engrossing to watch. Rocket also turns out to have a great dynamic with Yondu, as they're both the designated jackasses of the Guardians franchise. Baby Groot, meanwhile, is the ""baby"" of the movie, as he's put into several dangerous situations and everybody needs to watch after him. He's also pretty adorable, and like in the first movie, he gets the full range of emotions due to his mannerisms and vocal intonations despite only saying three words throughout. Vin Diesel's voice acting is great, and not something you'd expect from a guy who's been in several auto-heist movies.One thing that's interesting about Vol. 2 is its Empire-like ending. Unlike most superhero movies, the heroes don't make it out completely unscathed, and it actually ends on a bit of a somber note. Sure, everybody comes out stronger and more hopeful, but they've suffered a big loss, and it's something that may exact a big toll on Quill going forward. It's a refreshing change of pace from the formula that's been established for the superhero genre, and I wouldn't mind seeing more of it in other superhero flicks.Vol. 2 is great, and I look forward to more adventures with the Guardians of the Galaxy.","[['Vol'], ['Galaxy', 'Peter Quill', 'parentage', 'a race', 'Sovereign'], ['Yondu', 'a huge payday', 'Yondu', 'certain death'], ['the main cast', 'the first movie', 'return', 'Kurt Russell', 'Ego', 'Pom Klementieff', 'Mantis', 'Elizabeth Debicki', 'Ayesha.James Gunn', 'this movie', 'a lot', 'the credit', 'this movie', 'success'], ['irreverent-yet-still-emotionally-affecting style'], ['the hero', 'the same time', 'Nebula', 'Yondu.Kurt Russell', 'Ego', 'Peter', 'father'], ['character', 'fit', 'right', 'the goofy'], ['Klementieff', 'Mantis', 'a standout character', 'endearing', 'a strong rapport', 'the veteran', 'Guardians', 'Drax', 'beats.The', 'Gamora/Nebula', 'sisterhood', 'this film'], ['a complicated history', 'trauma', 'Thanos'], ['Karen Gillan', 'a great job', 'material', 'Zoe Saldana', 'Gamora', 'complex character', 'performance'], ['Thanos', 'play', 'Infinity War.Yondu', 'expanded role', 'welcome surprise'], ['an egotistical jackass', 'a pretty decent guy', 'the pirate', 'suit', 'no-nonsense exterior'], ['Michael Rooker', 'a great job', 'this new material', 'Chris Pratt'], ['Speaking', 'Pratt', 'Quill'], ['Quill', 'dealt', 'a lot', 'emotional trauma', 'life', 'play', 'a number', 'this movie'], ['Gamora', 'Ego.Rocket Raccoon'], ['Rocket', 'CGI', 'Vol'], ['the character'], ['Rocket', 'intimacy', 'past trauma', 'Quill'], ['Rocket', 'Yondu', 'franchise'], ['Baby Groot', 'baby', 'the movie', 'everybody'], ['the first movie', 'the full range'], ['Vin Diesel', 'voice', 'acting', 'something', 'a guy', 'thing', 'Vol'], [], ['a bit', 'a somber note'], ['everybody', 'a big loss', 'something', 'a big toll', 'Quill'], ['a refreshing change', 'pace', 'the formula', 'the superhero', 'genre', 'other superhero', 'flicks.Vol'], ['Galaxy']]","[['few months', 'first Guardians', 'Vol'], ['Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'Peter Quill', 'parentage', 'race', 'Sovereign'], ['Yondu', 'Ravagers', 'Guardians', 'huge payday', 'Yondu', 'Guardians', 'certain death'], ['cast members', 'movie return', 'Kurt Russell', 'Ego', 'Pom Klementieff', 'Mantis', 'Elizabeth Debicki', 'Ayesha.James Gunn', 'movie', 'lot', 'credit', 'movie', 'success'], ['irreverent-yet-still-emotionally-affecting style', 'guys', 'Guardians'], ['hero characters', 'relationships', 'same time', 'backstories', 'characters like Nebula', 'Yondu.Kurt Russell', 'Ego', 'Peter', 'father'], ['character fit right', 'goofy', 'comedic Guardians', 'real motivations'], ['Klementieff', 'Mantis', 'standout character', 'endearing', 'strong rapport', 'veteran Guardians', 'Drax', 'several funny lines', 'beats.The Gamora/Nebula sisterhood', 'film'], ['sisters', 'complicated history', 'trauma', 'hands of Thanos', 'endeavors'], ['Karen Gillan', 'great job', 'material', 'Zoe Saldana', 'Gamora', 'complex character', 'performance'], ['Thanos', 'play in Infinity War.Yondu', 'expanded role', 'welcome surprise'], ['egotistical jackass', 'pretty decent guy', 'pirate suit', 'no-nonsense exterior'], ['Michael Rooker', 'great job', 'new material', 'Chris Pratt'], ['Speaking', 'Pratt', 'Quill'], ['Quill', 'dealt', 'lot', 'emotional trauma', 'life', 'play', 'number of ways', 'movie'], ['trauma beings', 'relationships', 'several people', 'Gamora', 'Ego.Rocket Raccoon'], ['Rocket', 'CGI', 'Vol'], ['character'], ['Rocket', 'intimacy', 'past trauma', 'Quill'], ['Rocket', 'Yondu', 'designated jackasses', 'Guardians franchise'], ['Baby Groot', 'baby', 'movie', 'several dangerous situations and everybody'], ['first movie', 'range of emotions', 'mannerisms', 'vocal intonations', 'words'], ['Vin Diesel', 'voice acting', 'something', 'guy', 'movies.One thing', 'Vol'], [], ['superhero movies', 'heroes', 'bit', 'somber note'], ['everybody', 'big loss', 'something', 'toll on Quill'], ['change of pace', 'formula', 'superhero genre', 'superhero flicks.Vol'], ['adventures', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy']]"
156,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"""I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!""","I liked the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie. It was fun and flashy, a good summer movie. However, Volume 2 is just marvelous, a blockbuster that does more than just entertain you for two hours; this movie is character-driven, even philosophical. It touches on themes of family, love, and altruism. Like Empire Strikes Back, it is a sequel which includes everything we loved about the first installment while also upping the emotional stakes and putting the heroes we've come to love through hell and back.A lot of summer movies come and go. You spend eight bucks, have fun for two hours, and then forget what you saw days afterward. But this movie gives you something more than a few one-liners and cool fight scenes: it's emotionally engaging.

160,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Awesome Mix Vol. 2,"I went to see this movie expecting something similar to the first one, full of action, special effects and so on. In many aspects, this is up to the first one with many spectacular action sequences, full of jokes (sometimes unnecessary jokes, but it's Marvel, and I say that as no offense, don't get me wrong, but sometimes they feel like a bit off- place).One of the best things of this movie compared to the first one, is the character development of many of the characters (specially the secondary ones of the first movie). Okay, it's not a very big development but we get to know a bit more of the past lives of all the guardians. I liked the introduction of Nebula again because it gave some emotional moments with her relationship with Gamora. Also one of the best improvements is the character of Yondu. At the beginning you feel like he won't do anything special, just kill a few people with his flying arrow, but when he goes to rescue Peter to the planet of his father, you start to like him, and at the end you feel like he is the real father of Peter, not his monstrous planet-destroyer father.The other great thing, as the same as the first one, is the Awesome Mix of songs used in the soundtrack. Not only the great main theme which was used, but also all the songs that we hear in the Awesome Mix Vol. 2 of the mix tape of Peter. The music makes you feel. From the first hilarious scene, with Baby Groot dancing around, to the final emotional scene with all the ships shooting the fireworks in the funeral. About this I have to add that is the first time that a Marvel-Disney movie gives a character such an emotional end, that actually makes you care about him.One of the things I felt were down to the original is, obviously, the surprise. If you have watched the first one, you know how it is, and in this movie you are expecting something similar so in this aspect, there were parts that felt like a bit the same as the first one. Also there are some characters that are a bit useless. Sylvester Stallone in fact doesn't do anything that is worth for his presence but it doesen't bother too much. Also this is similar with Elizabeth Debicki, who I feel that in some parts was great but a bit unnecessary in others, and I think she has been introduced here for the sequel. You know what I mean if you stay in all the end credits, and believe me, it's worth the wait.In general, in some aspects is very similar to the first one, but not in every moments that means a bad thing. Overall this provides a very good entertainment movie full of action and emotion with a great soundtrack.Recommended to every Marvel, superhero, space or action movie fan.","[['this movie', 'something', 'action'], ['the first one', 'many spectacular action', 'Marvel', 'no offense', 'a bit', 'off- place', '.One', 'this movie', 'the character', 'development', 'the first movie'], ['Okay', 'big development', 'a bit'], ['the introduction', 'Nebula', 'relationship', 'Gamora'], ['the character', 'Yondu'], ['the beginning', 'anything', 'arrow', 'Peter', 'the planet', 'father', 'the end', 'the real father', 'Peter', 'monstrous planet-destroyer', 'father.The', 'other great thing', 'Awesome Mix', 'the soundtrack'], ['the great main theme', 'Awesome Mix Vol'], ['the mix', 'tape', 'Peter'], ['The music'], ['the first hilarious scene', 'Baby Groot', 'the final emotional scene'], ['the first time', 'Marvel-Disney', 'movie', 'a character', 'an emotional end', 'him.One', 'the surprise'], ['this movie', 'something', 'this aspect', 'a bit', 'the first one'], ['a bit'], ['Sylvester Stallone', 'fact', 'anything', 'presence'], ['Elizabeth Debicki', 'a bit', 'the sequel'], ['the end', 'a bad thing'], ['good entertainment', 'movie', 'action', 'emotion', 'Marvel', 'superhero', 'space', 'action', 'movie', 'fan']]","[['movie', 'something', 'action', 'special effects'], ['many aspects', 'first one', 'action sequences', 'jokes', 'unnecessary jokes', 'Marvel', 'offense', 'bit', 'off- place', '.One', 'things', 'movie', 'character development', 'characters', 'secondary ones', 'first movie'], ['Okay', 'big development', 'bit', 'past lives', 'guardians'], ['introduction of Nebula', 'emotional moments', 'relationship with Gamora'], ['improvements', 'character of Yondu'], ['beginning', 'anything', 'few people', 'arrow', 'Peter', 'planet', 'father', 'end', 'father of Peter', 'planet-destroyer father.The', 'other great thing', 'Awesome Mix', 'songs', 'soundtrack'], ['great main theme', 'songs', 'Awesome Mix Vol'], ['mix tape', 'Peter'], ['music'], ['first hilarious scene', 'Baby Groot', 'final emotional scene', 'ships', 'fireworks'], ['first time', 'Marvel-Disney movie', 'character', 'emotional end', 'him.One', 'things', 'surprise'], ['movie', 'something', 'aspect', 'parts', 'bit', 'first one'], ['characters', 'bit'], ['Sylvester Stallone', 'fact', 'anything', 'presence'], ['Elizabeth Debicki', 'parts', 'bit', 'others', 'sequel'], ['end credits', 'aspects', 'moments', 'bad thing'], ['entertainment movie', 'action and emotion', 'Marvel', 'superhero', 'space', 'action movie fan']]"
161,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,We are Groot,"Guardians of the Galaxy was a fresh story that we knew nothing about (unless you are a Marvel fan, the you knew almost everything). Now we know these characters and the story continuous keeping the same style of the first movie, but with more laughs than ever.We find our heroes together some time after the first movie, doing their businesses, and for this movie the main plot it's Star-Lords origins, which of course they might not be as they look like. While his background story is interesting, there is a lack of magic like in the first movie, of course it was something new back then and now we have the same. But the movie lacks the kind of action and story that the first had. Plus, this one is really a stand alone movie, not connected at all with the MCU (for the moment). If the movie wasn't there, maybe we wouldn't miss anything of the whole story arcs.Yes, you cannot stop laughing, because let's be clear, more than an action film it looks like a comedy one. Specially with the pair that Racoon and Groot are, once again they steal the show, specially baby Groot. But it's not only Star-Lords parentage that we learn about, we also learn the other backgrounds, which is good, as there were many questions unanswered in the first movie and in this one we get them.As always, the movie is pure a visual effect, which nowadays we are really used to watch, but maybe one of the best scenes is the opening sequence. Then, another detail that this movie has as its predecessor it's the music, that 80s style is really present through the whole movie, and personally one of my favorite ones is during the rolling of the credits, so stay tuned. And don't forget to stay seated until the very end of the movie, as there are not one, nor, two, nor three, nor four, but five post-credit scenes. Yes, a bit of an overload, but there are a couple that looks really interesting..Remember: #WeAreGroot","[['Galaxy', 'a fresh story', 'nothing', 'Marvel', 'fan', 'everything'], ['the story', 'the same style', 'the first movie', 'some time', 'the first movie', 'this movie', 'the main plot', 'course'], ['background', 'story', 'a lack', 'magic', 'the first movie', 'course', 'something'], ['the movie', 'the kind', 'action', 'story'], ['a stand', 'movie', 'MCU', 'the moment'], ['the movie', 'anything', 'the whole story', 'arcs.Yes', 'laughing', 'let', 'an action', 'film', 'a comedy'], ['the pair', 'Racoon', 'Groot', 'the show', 'Groot'], ['Star-Lords parentage', 'the first movie', 'the movie', 'a visual effect', 'the opening', 'sequence'], ['another detail', 'this movie', 'predecessor', 'the music', 'style', 'the whole movie', 'the rolling'], ['end', 'the movie'], ['a bit', 'an overload', 'a couple', 'Remember', 'WeAreGroot']]","[['Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'fresh story', 'nothing', 'Marvel fan', 'everything'], ['characters', 'story', 'same style', 'first movie', 'laughs', 'heroes', 'time', 'first movie', 'businesses', 'movie', 'main plot', 'Star-Lords origins', 'course'], ['background story', 'lack of magic', 'first movie', 'course', 'something'], ['movie', 'kind of action', 'story'], ['stand', 'movie', 'MCU', 'moment'], ['movie', 'anything', 'story arcs.Yes', 'laughing', 'let', 'action film', 'comedy'], ['pair', 'Racoon and Groot', 'show', 'baby Groot'], ['Star-Lords parentage', 'other backgrounds', 'many questions', 'first movie', 'movie', 'visual effect', 'scenes', 'opening sequence'], ['detail', 'movie', 'predecessor', 'music', 'style', 'whole movie', 'favorite ones', 'rolling', 'credits'], ['end', 'movie', 'post-credit scenes'], ['bit', 'overload', 'couple', 'interesting ..

163,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,The Guardians Strike Back,"I was lucky enough to see this on 20/4 at an industry screening which allowed me to sit on the film for a few days before I gave a review. I can safely say GotG Volume 2 absolutely wowed me. I can't believe these bunch of lovable misfit a-holes made one of the most MATURE themed films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film is visually gorgeous. The use of colour, design and the straight up imagination of the source material outstand any MCU film prior. The action is glorious and astonishing. One scene in particular, I was jaw-dropped in its entirety as direction, action-choreography and music all came together so harmoniously. And THE MUSIC! What an eargasmic soundtrack. The songs are more poetic this time around and fit the subtext of the film perfectly. The trailers gave me the feel of the first movie; a straight-up Sci-fi action-comedy with a simple point A to B plot. GotGV2 is so much MORE than this! This film is patient with its characters and there is an emphasis on growth and family. It manages to balance 7-8 characters and gives almost all of them a satisfactory emotional arc. There is so much to chew on here with the issues and motifs felt by certain characters and I applaud that! This film is vastly different and I'm glad because I just love these characters so much! They are still so fun and energetic. It's great to see the team again and how their dynamic transforms. Also I forget to mention, the film is laugh-out-loud funny! All thanks to Drax who is by far the most comedic character and put me stitches.Overall, this was both (I can't believe I'm saying this about the Guardians of the Galaxy) an emotionally dense and exciting blast. If Guardians 1 is the fast-paced Sci-Fi adventure like Star Wars was in 1977, then Vol. 2 is the deeper & richer film that takes its time to expand our beloved characters; just like Empire Strikes Back.","[['an industry', 'the film', 'a review'], ['GotG', 'Volume'], ['these bunch', 'lovable misfit', 'MATURE', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe'], ['The film'], ['The use', 'colour', 'design', 'imagination', 'the source', 'material', 'outstand', 'MCU', 'film'], ['The action', 'astonishing'], ['scene', 'entirety', 'direction', 'action-choreography', 'music'], ['MUSIC'], ['an eargasmic soundtrack'], ['this time', 'the subtext', 'the film'], ['the feel', 'the first movie', 'a straight-up Sci-fi action-comedy', 'a simple point', 'B', 'plot'], ['GotGV2'], ['This film', 'an emphasis', 'growth', 'family'], ['a satisfactory emotional arc'], [], ['This film'], [], ['the team'], ['the film', 'laugh-out-loud funny'], ['Drax', 'comedic character', 'Galaxy', 'dense', 'exciting blast'], ['Guardians', 'the fast-paced Sci-Fi adventure', 'Star Wars', 'Vol'], ['film', 'time', 'Empire Strikes Back']]","[['industry', 'film', 'few days', 'review'], ['GotG Volume'], ['bunch', 'misfit a-holes', 'MATURE', 'films', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe'], ['film'], ['use of colour', 'design', 'imagination', 'source material outstand', 'MCU film'], ['action', 'astonishing'], ['scene', 'entirety as direction', 'action-choreography and music'], ['MUSIC'], ['eargasmic soundtrack'], ['songs', 'time', 'subtext', 'film'], ['trailers', 'feel', 'first movie', 'straight-up Sci-fi action-comedy', 'simple point', 'B plot'], ['GotGV2'], ['film', 'characters', 'emphasis on growth', 'family'], ['7-8 characters', 'satisfactory emotional arc'], ['issues and motifs', 'certain characters'], ['film', 'characters'], [], ['team', 'dynamic transforms'], ['film', 'laugh-out-loud funny'], ['thanks', 'Drax', 'comedic character', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'dense', 'exciting blast'], ['Guardians', 'adventure like Star Wars', 'Vol'], ['film', 'time', 'beloved characters', 'Empire Strikes Back']]"

165,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Groot Expectations,"James Gunn is back writing and directing the sequel to his surprise 2014 summer hit. And it might be a fresh mix tape slammed into the Walkman, but it's much of the same again. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing.In terms of the story, it's almost a remake of the worst Star Trek film ever made! However, this time its all done for 'laffs' and so works much, much better. We join Quill (Chris Pratt, ""Jurassic World""), Gamora (Zoe Saldana, ""Star Trek Beyond""), Drax (Dave Bautista, ""Spectre"") and Rocket (the voice of Bradley Cooper) 'ever ready' (LOL) to save the priceless Anulax batteries of their current employees, the Sovereigns, from the ravages of some multi-dimensional being. 'Helping' them is Baby Groot, a twig off the old branch from the first film, again voiced (in what must be the easiest money in Hollywood) by Vin Diesel (""Fast and Furious 8"").The Sovereign's High Priestess (Elizabeth Debicki, ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E."") provides payment to Gamora in the form of her chained-up evil sister Nebula (a deliciously sulky Karen Gillen, ""Dr Who"", ""Oculus"") but is then less than impressed when the mercenary Rocket pockets a knapsack full of the batteries. So starts a chase across the galaxy leading Quill to meet Ego (Kurt Russell, ""The Hateful 8"") on the planet Ego (LOL) at the very base of his family tree.The great thing about these films is that they don't even TRY to be realistic. Characters get towed behind crashing spaceships and - literally- dragged through a wood backwards; others fall hundreds of feet to certain death... no, sorry, a ""superhero landing""; and planets and characters are painted with a garishness never ever to be found in nature. You'll even believe Kurt Russell is 18 again - oh that these effects were available on the British NHS! But the other saving grace for this film is the soundtrack, put together by Tyler Bates as an ode to the 80's, with wonderful tracks by ELO, Fleetwood Mac, Cat Stevens and a host of others. The film matches the music with the action superbly. I won't bother commenting on the acting... who cares with this sort of film! But everyone seems to have fun with Michael Rooker (""Cliffhanger"") being particularly good in reprising his role of Yondu. There are also a wealth of memorable cameos, some of them being laugh out loud moments. While some of the pop culture references might go over a younger audience's heads, there are still enough great one- liners and comic moments to provide general appeal. Bad guys silhouetted against the moon, ET style, was particularly memorable. One criticism I would have though is that it's just too darn long for an ""action comedy"". The original film just about scraped into my good books by coming in under the two hour curfew. The sequel however adds another 15 minutes, which should have found its way either onto the cutting room floor or onto the ""Blu Ray collector's edition"". In particular, the final never-ending showdown of CGI manicness went on too long for my liking. Looking back at the original 2014 review, I gave it a rather stingy 6* rating, which in retrospect I think was a bit mean given its novelty. This time the novelty has worn off, but if anything this is an even more enjoyable romp that the first outing.

166,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"Prepare to, once again, get hooked on a feeling","Three years ago, Marvel Studios and James Gunn introduced us to the Guardians of the Galaxy, a superhero team of outcasts and misfits who resembled more of a dysfunctional family than a cohesive unit setting out to save the galaxy. It's safe to say the world fell in love with them right there and then, and now they're back in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, the fifteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.With the Guardians of the Galaxy, consisting of Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Baby Groot (Vin Diesel), renowned as heroes and hired to defend the galaxy, it's not long before they find themselves on the run again. The trials and tribulations they face along the way pushes their relationships to new limits, all while Quill discovers the truth behind his parentage.While others moan that the MCU is becoming quite tiresome, I can't help but feel that it seems fresher than ever, particularly when they can break away to something as different as Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. While it may not spring as much of a surprise on its audience as the first film this sequel doesn't try to be a carbon copy, exceeding any expectations I had going in.Going from one of Marvel Studios' biggest gambles to one of their most profitable properties is some achievement for Guardians of the Galaxy, and a lot of the success they've had has to go down to James Gunn. Gunn's work on the first film drew a lot of Star Wars comparisons with the whole space opera ideology and in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Gunn has made his Empire Strikes Back, with a strong sequel full of adventure, fractured relationships and a narrative that even comes with the father/son elements.The film is much funnier than its predecessor, the jokes coming thick and fast, with Drax and Baby Groot getting the lions share of them, and Gunn really does knock it out of the park with both the visual and verbal pop culture references. That doesn't mean the film's narrative is sacrificed in any shape or form mind, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 going on to become one of the more personal and emotional films within the MCU. One of the best things about the first film was the awesome soundtrack the film played out to. Like I've said already though, this isn't a carbon copy so they don't just pick random songs because they sound cool alongside an action sequence. The songs really do excel the film at times, Come A Little Bit Closer, Father and Son and The Chain being the stand-outs this time round. Oh, and Mr. Blue Sky deserves a special mention for playing over the best opening title sequences ever, and you'll find it hard to disagree when you see it for yourself.Coming to the performances, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 sees the fine ensemble cast return along with the addition of some very welcome new cast members. Chris Pratt leads the cast with copious amounts of charisma as Peter Quill embarks on a journey into his parentage, Zoe Saldana really does hone in on the fierceness of Gamora whenever she feels like it, Dave Bautista is, once again, hilarious as Drax, his laugh being one of the most infectious you'll hear in any film and the stellar vocal performance from Bradley Cooper as Rocket is one of the highlights of the film.Michael Rooker and Karen Gillan return as Yondu and Nebula respectively, getting more to sink their teeth into this time round and each of them provides the film with some of its more prevalent heartbeats. There's also the new additions to the cast that come in the shape of Kurt Russell as Ego, a cosmic being and Quill's father, and Pom Klementieff as Mantis, Ego's empathic assistant. Russell just oozes the same charisma as Pratt so no surprise they seem to go hand-in-hand as father and son, and Klementieff does a great job in selling the innocence of Mantis as well as showing fine comedic qualities, mainly in her scenes alongside Bautista.As expected with these big budget superhero films now, the visual effects look stunning and in the case of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, they play a major part in making these films feel so detached from the rest of the MCU. The vibrant colours add even more energy to the already electric action sequences, turning the film into even more of a thrilling ride in the process. I could honestly sit and type for hours on end regarding how much I loved Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 but rather than do that, I'll just go and see the film again and again because this film has so much to give. I'm certainly hooked on a feeling again and I'm sure it won't be long before the rest of the world follows suit.","[['Marvel Studios', 'James Gunn', 'Galaxy', 'a superhero', 'team', 'a dysfunctional

167,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Guardians of the Galaxy 2 Was GREAT sequel!!!,Kurt Russell looks great for his age!! The movie is a awesome addition to the Guardians series! The movie has a storyline that is completely easy to follow and adds to the first movie. They really used all of the original actors and then added a lot of extra storyline with the new actors they added in. I cannot wait to see volume 3!!!!!!,"[['Kurt Russell', 'age'], ['The movie', 'a awesome addition', 'Guardians', 'series'], ['The movie', 'a storyline', 'the first movie'], ['a lot', 'extra storyline'], ['volume'], []]","[['Kurt Russell', 'age'], ['movie', 'awesome addition', 'Guardians series'], ['movie', 'storyline', 'first movie'], ['original actors', 'lot', 'extra storyline', 'new actors'], ['volume'], []]"
168,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,I'm surprised. This is my favorite MCU movie after Captain America:Civil War.,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a 15th movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Time flies, huh? With all bigger comic book movies coming out in 2017 I was actually the least hyped for this one. There were some reasons to worry. Usually when a sequel tries to outdo the original by going bigger, it turns into a mess. And I'm happy to say that wasn't the case with this one.The plot is actually rather straightforward but it's how it's done that matters here. The characters are all likable and well fleshed-out, the dialogue is witty and well-written (except for a few cringy jokes, but those tiny parts are easy to forget), the actors give their best in their roles and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing! First one was also entertaining, but it just didn't really feel as good as this one, you don't have that sense of a team and friendship in the first one because they were still introducing to each other and getting together. Here, the chemistry is real. And now that you know the characters, it's a lot easier to relate and feel for them. The emotions are strong with this one, trust me. Also, if you're looking for answers you didn't get in the first one, you will get them here. And finally, another great villain. Not forgettable like in many MCU movies.So, in short, I said everything I wanted about this movie. The plot may be simpler than the predecessor's but this one is so much more enjoyable, heartwarming and emotional. You will want to come back to this one more than the first one. At least I know I will.","[['Galaxy Vol'], ['a 15th movie', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe'], ['Time', 'huh'], ['comic book'], [], ['a sequel', 'a mess'], ['the case', 'this one.The', 'plot'], ['fleshed-out', 'the dialogue', 'a few cringy', 'the soundtrack'], ['one', 'that sense', 'a team', 'friendship', 'the first one'], ['the chemistry'], ['a lot'], ['trust'], [], ['another great villain'], ['MCU', 'movies.So', 'everything', 'this movie'], ['The plot', 'the predecessor'], ['the first one'], []]","[['Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['15th movie', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe'], ['Time flies', 'huh'], ['book movies'], ['reasons'], ['sequel', 'mess'], ['case', 'one.The plot', 'matters'], ['characters', 'fleshed-out', 'dialogue', 'cringy jokes', 'tiny parts', 'actors', 'roles', 'soundtrack'], ['one', 'sense', 'team and friendship', 'first one'], ['chemistry'], ['characters', 'lot'], ['emotions', 'trust'], ['answers'], ['great villain'], ['MCU movies.So', 'everything', 'movie'], ['plot', 'predecessor'], ['first one'], []]"
169,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,The Least Little Spoilers for an Outstanding Movie!,"Prior to seeing Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, I said that it would have a hard time equaling the perfect blend of humor and action that the first Guardians achieved. After seeing Vol. 2, however, I have to say that it achieved a perfect balance of humor, action and even tear-jerking drama. Although I would hardly have believed it possible, I enjoyed Vol. 2 a bit more even than the first Guardians movie.Chris Pratt does such a brilliant job of conveying dry, understated humor that it's easy to take for his performance for granted, but when I, and the rest of the theater, laughed over and over, it served as a good reminder just what great comedic talent he brings to what are genuinely serious superhero movies. Not to be outdone, Kurt Russell—a talented actor of whom I just haven't seen enough in recent years—did a brilliant job of making Star Lord's father completely believable, even relatable, at the same time he turns totally creepy on us.I have to give a shout out to Zoe Saldana, who some of you might know as Uhura in the Kelvin timeline Star Trek movies. It's hard for anyone to reprise the role brought so lovingly to life by Nichelle Nichols in original Star Trek, and I didn't even recognize Zoe under all that green makeup in the first Guardians movie. Knowing who she was in Vol. 2, however, I was impressed by her range as an actress, as she made Gamora completely and unrecognizably different than her Uhura. Another talented actress I didn't recognize under all her makeup (or prosthetics) was Karen Gillian, who some of you might know as the red-haired beauty who played Amy Pond in 36 episodes of Doctor Who. Once again, her range as an actress made her character, Nebula, completely and utterly different from her Amy.Sean Gunn, perhaps a less-familiar actor, unless you, like me, happen to enjoy both superhero movies and ""chick"" shows, brought the same sort of lovably bumbling humor to the character of Kraglin in the movie that he brought so enjoyably most weeks on the Gilmore Girls TV series. Gunn's performance contributed greatly to the movie's ability to make the entire audience laugh even when Chris Pratt wasn't on the screen.Once you've seen Vol. 2—and definitely not before—take a gander in the Internet Movie Database at the movie's cast, and you may be surprised to see several other talented actors playing roles either openly (but not advertised beforehand) or hidden behind makeup or CGI. Some of them you'll have already happily recognized during the movie, but the list of others that you probably didn't recognize might well delight you as did me. Let me warn you again though: if you haven't seen the movie yet, do NOT look at IMDb.I would be remiss if I didn't mention the movie's absolutely outstanding use of 1970s music. Someone on the production crew grew up at the same time I did, and I have to give him or her credit for choosing some great songs from our youth that fit the events of the movie perfectly. The first movie had good period music too, but I have to say that when it comes to the appropriate use of 1970s music, the filmmakers might accurately have titled the Vol. 2 movie Guardians Beyond.If you do go see Guardians Vol. 2—and I've tried my best to gush about the movie without giving away a single darned spoiler—make sure you sit through the closing credits to the very, absolutely final, last second. Don't just wait patiently, either, for during-credits or after-credits scenes, but really, really, really try to pay attention to both the words and the images in the credits themselves, and you will be richly rewarded with even more humor.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 represents another unqualified cinematic triumph for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and sets the stage for what could well end up being at least two more. As a major DC Comics fan for more than half a century, I have to say that I wish the DC Expanded Universe movies had even a quarter as much talent putting together live-action DC superhero movies. Is there any chance that Warner Brothers might borrow some of the leading creative lights of Disney's Marvel Studios for at least one superhero movie?!","[['Galaxy Vol'], ['a hard time', 'the perfect blend', 'humor', 'action'], ['Vol'], ['a perfect balance', 'humor', 'action', 'tear-jerking drama'], ['Vol'], ['a bit', 'Pratt', 'a brilliant job', 'understated humor', 'performance', 'the rest', 'the theater', 'a good reminder', 'great comedic talent', 'serious superhero'], ['Kurt Russell—a', 'actor', 'recent years—did', 'a brilliant job', 'Star Lord', 'father', 'the same time', 'a shout', 'Zoe Saldana', 'Uhura', 'Kelvin', 'timeline', 'Star Trek'], ['anyone', 'the role', 'life', 'Nichelle Nichols', 'Star Trek', 'Zoe', 'that green makeup', 'movie'], ['Vol'], ['range', 'an actress', 'Gamora', 'Uhura'], ['actress', 'makeup', 'Karen Gillian', 'the red-haired beauty', 'Amy Pond', 'Doctor Who'], ['range', 'an actress', 'character', 'Nebula', 'Amy.Sean Gunn', 'a less-familiar actor', 'chick', 'the same sort', 'humor', 'the character', 'Kraglin', 'the movie', 'Gilmore Girls TV', 'series'], ['Gunn', 'performance', 'the movie', 'ability', 'the entire audience', 'laugh', 'Chris Pratt', 'the screen.Once', 'Vol'], ['a gander', 'Internet Movie Database', 'the movie', 'cast', 'advertised beforehand', 'makeup', 'CGI'], ['the movie', 'the list'], ['the movie', 'NOT', 'IMDb.I', 'the movie', 'outstanding use', 'music'], ['Someone', 'the production', 'crew', 'the same time', 'credit', 'youth', 'the movie'], ['The first movie', 'good period', 'music', 'the appropriate use', 'music', 'Vol'], ['movie', 'Beyond.If', 'Vol'], ['the movie', 'a single darned spoiler—make', 'sure', 'the closing', 'last second'], ['attention', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['another unqualified cinematic triumph', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe', 'the stage'], ['DC Comics', 'fan', 'a century', 'DC Expanded Universe', 'a quarter', 'much talent', 'live-action', 'DC', 'superhero'], ['any chance', 'Warner', 'Disney', 'Marvel Studios', 'superhero', 'movie'], []]","[['Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['hard time', 'blend of humor', 'action', 'first Guardians'], ['Vol'], ['balance of humor', 'action', 'tear-jerking drama'], ['Vol'], ['bit', 'first Guardians', 'movie.Chris Pratt', 'brilliant job', 'understated humor', 'performance', 'rest', 'theater', 'good reminder', 'great comedic talent', 'superhero movies'], ['Kurt Russell—a', 'actor', 'recent years—did', 'brilliant job', 'Star Lord', 'father', 'same time', 'us.I', 'shout', 'Zoe Saldana', 'Uhura', 'Kelvin timeline Star Trek movies'], ['anyone', 'role', 'life by Nichelle Nichols', 'Star Trek', 'Zoe', 'green makeup', 'Guardians movie'], ['Vol'], ['range', 'actress', 'Gamora', 'Uhura'], ['actress', 'makeup', 'prosthetics', 'Karen Gillian', 'red-haired beauty', 'Amy Pond', 'episodes of Doctor Who'], ['range', 'actress', 'character', 'Nebula', 'Amy.Sean Gunn', 'less-familiar actor', 'superhero movies', 'chick', 'shows', 'same sort', 'humor', 'character of Kraglin', 'movie', 'weeks', 'Gilmore Girls TV series'], ['Gunn', 'performance', 'movie', 'ability', 'audience laugh', 'Chris Pratt', 'screen.Once', 'Vol'], ['gander', 'Internet Movie Database', 'movie', 'cast', 'actors', 'roles', 'advertised beforehand', 'makeup or CGI'], ['movie', 'list of others'], ['movie', 'NOT', 'IMDb.I', 'movie', 'outstanding use', 'music'], ['Someone', 'production crew', 'same time', 'credit', 'great songs', 'youth', 'events', 'movie'], ['first movie', 'period music', 'appropriate use', 'music', 'filmmakers', 'Vol'], ['movie Guardians Beyond.If', 'Guardians Vol'], ['movie', 'spoiler—make sure', 'closing credits', 'last second'], ['during-credits', 'after-credits scenes', 'attention', 'words', 'images', 'credits', 'humor.Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['unqualified cinematic triumph', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe', 'stage'], ['DC Comics fan', 'century', 'DC Expanded Universe movies', 'quarter', 'much talent', 'live-action DC superhero movies'], ['chance that Warner Brothers', 'lights of Disney', 'Marvel Studios', 'superhero movie'], []]"
170,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2""- A laugh-out-loud and wildly entertaining follow-up that is almost derailed by a messy first act, but quickly corrects itself and delivers!","The first ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" was a magical film, and one of those rare examples of ""fun"" in its purest form. Seeing it in a packed theater with the right audience was mind-blowing, and it was a joy seeing everyone come together to just have a blast with its delightful characters. But even beyond that, it was also an expertly written, often stirring and enthralling and even sometimes surprisingly emotional work thanks to the talents of director James Gunn and his wonderful cast. Heck, the first movie literally had a scene where a gun-toting, smack-talking raccoon cried because his living-tree best friend appeared to die... and I heard more than a few sniffles coming from the audience. It was clearly doing something right and pressing all of the correct buttons.And I'm more than happy to report that despite a shaky first act that nearly lost me, Gunn's follow-up ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" delivers much of the same high-quality entertainment of its predecessor. It's got all of our favorite characters, an intriguing new story filled to burst with shocks and laughs, and the same big heart that made part one such a rampant success. It might be a tab bit rough around the edges... but it pulls through and gives you more of exactly what you want to see.The Guardians may be in over their head when member Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper) decides to steal some tech from a race of prestigious beings known as ""The Sovereign,"" who respond by attacking the them and leaving them stranded on an uncharted alien world. Luckily enough, they soon are greeted by the mysterious god-like Celestial being ""Ego"" (Kurt Russell), who offers to help them because, well... he also just so happens to be the long- lost father of their leader Peter Quill, aka ""StarLord."" (Chris Pratt) While Peter catches up with his father, the other members of the team are off on their own adventures, as Gamora (Zoe Saldana) tries to settle the score with her sister Nebula (Karen Gillan), Drax (Dave Bautista) takes a liking to Ego's assistant Mantis (Pom Klementieff) and Rocket and Groot (voice of Vin Diesel) are forced to team up with former-Ravager captain Yondu (Michael Rooker), after the three are captured during a mutiny while the Ravagers try to retrieve the Guardians for a hefty bounty.The film did initial have me at a bit of a worry. After a spellbinding and hilarious opening action set-piece set to the iconic ELO masterpiece ""Mr. Blue Sky"", the film does dip into convoluted territory for much of its first act. There's just a bit too much going on a bit too quickly, as new characters are established, old characters are re- established, and an intricate web of sub-plots and B-story lines are set up. It almost lost me for a few minutes there. And I worried the whole film would feel overstuffed and aimless. But fear not, because Mr. Gunn knows exactly what he's doing, and every single thing that it established early on pays off in the later sequences. It might not seem like it at first... but there's a grand plan at play. So I can easily forgive the fact that the first twenty or so minutes doesn't flow particularly well. The pacing and focus quickly corrects itself, and we can see why it needed to speed through so much, so quickly.Much like the original, a great part of the success of the film lays on its incredible cast. Every single returning player is a phenomena, especially Pratt and Rooker, who are given a lot of emotional pay- off in the film as they deal with their respective issues and arcs. The new cast members are a welcome addition. I especially must give major praise to the genius that is Kurt Russell. I've always been a fan of his, especially in his ""crazier"" work. (""Big Trouble in Little China"" in my opinion being his greatest film.) And he's just outstanding here as the rugged and hilarious and sometimes questionable god-like being Ego. It's the perfect casting.Writer/director James Gunn is clearly having the time of his life, and his giddy attitude adds a lot to the proceedings. The first ""Guardians"" most certainly had his fingerprints all over it, but you got a feeling that he was perhaps holding back a bit. But for the sequel? He goes full-on insane in all the best ways! There's so many jokes. So many cameos. So many references. It's just crazy to think about how many zany details Gunn threw in, and I'm sure there's dozens of more in the background that I missed. Every single frame is saturated with pure Gunn mayhem, and I loved it. From the seemingly random insertion of familiar 8-bit video game sound effects into a number of action scenes, to entire sequences written around kitschy old pop-songs, to a climactic moment that I won't spoil, but I'm pretty sure was a giant ""Screw you!"" gag aimed at a recent high- profile critical disaster... It's so delightfully loving and geeky. And I can't wait to see what Gunn has up his sleeve for ""Vol. 3!""While I do have to dock a few minor points for my issues with the first act of the film, I can't see any fan of the original walking out disappointed. It's not only a great new addition to the ever- expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe... it's just a great, fun film, period. I attended a sold-out screening, and the laughter and cheers and whoops from the audience brought me right back to that same magical feeling I had watching the original. You done good, Mr. Gunn.

173,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"Perhaps not as spectacular as the first entry, but nonetheless exciting, funny, and visually stimulating as it needs to be","When Guardians of The Galaxy first hit the cinema multiplexes in the summer of 2014, it was a surprising success, especially for a superhero film based on comic books that very few knew about. Grossing around a quarter from crossing the billion-dollar mark, it was fairly predictable for a sequel to see the light of the day. This second installment, which helms director and writer James Gunn as the conductor, brings back our favorite heroes from the first film and places them in an all-new adventure. While this film made the score as a wild crowd-pleaser with its clever humor and tense, special-effects-laden galore, this one perhaps marks a just a slight stepback from its predecessor. Cutting back by a fraction on its zany, light-hearted tone in favor of deep character development and heart, this film delivers the fun and excitement with only a few flaws that go marginally noticeable. This film focuses on the Guardians: Peter Quill/Star Lord (played by Chris Pratt), Gamora (played by Zoe Saldana), Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), Drax (played by Dave Batista), and the now Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). The team travels to a distant planet where they come across a celestial named Ego (played by Kurt Russell) who happens to be Peter's long-lost father. The team soon sets out on an intergalactic adventure to discover the mysterious of Peter's strained past. Whereas the first installment ran off the chains with non-stop cheekiness and balls-to-the-walls humor, this movie takes a small step back to take a deep exploration into the characters, most particularly Peter Quill. This endeavor opens doors to a more powerful emotional core that taps into the heart strings. That is not the say the film does not leave any room for some light-hearted banter between the characters along with gut-busting one-liners. Although a small portion of the sexual innuendos tend to fall flat, the character certainly prove to be fighters for stealing the show from each other. The main driving force of the plot here is themes of family, that is where the dynamics of the father-son relationship between Peter Quill and Ego comes in. The story spends a portion of time diving into the relationship between Peter and his father, and what accounts is some emotionally resonating sequences that are surprisingly moving. But that is not all, the relationship Gamora and Nebula (played by Karen Gillian) is also greatly explored here, though perhaps not as ambitiously. The family dynamics result in numerous (and occasionally clunky) tonal shifts throughout the picture. Along the side, the film doesn't fail to fuel the adrenaline tank with visually stunning action sequences including spaceship battles and countless CGI explosions to keep things moving at a reasonable pace. And much like the previous movie, serving the backdrop of nearly every scene is a sweet classic 70s soundtrack to establish the cheeky mood of the story. The majority of the cast from the previous installment returns, each of them is good as ever. Chris Pratt, the likable guy he is, returns with a sheer amount of charisma and humor to his role. His humanistic performance serves as a supporting factor for his chemistry with new-face Kurt Russell who plays his father. The two share a strong emotional chemistry that greatly serves as a driving force the story. For fans of Russell, the actor never disappoints from his opening screen time, to the final act. Zoe Saldana is very strong in her role, boasting a fair amount of humanity with her emotional bond with Karen Gillian's Nebula. Bradley Cooper returns as the voice for the loud-bantering raccoon Rocket and continues to deliver one hilarious one-liner after another. Professional wrestler Dave Batista puts some great effort into the role of Drax, adding both humor and sentimental value to his already comedic figure. Groot who is now shrunk down to baby form is sustained by the voice of Vin Diesel who like the last film, never reaches a departure outside his signature lines ""I am Groot"". This little character is cute the second he appears on screen, and never fails to deliver the charm. Michael Rooker does his job as Yondu, another returning character. Sylvester Stallone makes a surprise appearance here as well, although his screen time is reduced to no longer than five minutes or so. Then there is Pom Klementieff as a telepathic mantis who swarms with a slice of humanity to her character, as well as a pinch of comedic chemistry with Dave Batista's Drax. If there is anything that chews at the clever chemistry between these characters, it is most likely the long separation between these characters with Peter, Gamora, and Drax spends a large amount of time on one planet, and Rocket and Groot on another, thus reducing the hilarious banter that contributes to these character's likability. Guardians of The Galaxy: Volume 2 is a fun follow-up to the 2014 original, with a fair amount of energy, heart, and humor to satisfy moviegoers of a various demographics. It's certainly not as polished as the previous entry, but that very little to bar from the insane amount of fun this movie is. This movie is an early summer blockbuster that is virtually impossible to doubt for reaching a phenomenal box office receipt by the end of the summer.","[['Galaxy', 'the cinema', 'the summer', 'a

Plot of the movies was already seen but it do the job. And villain is pretty cool as well.On the other hand, The problem I had with movie is that it tried too much to be funny the whole time, some jokes are forced and unnecessary, There are scenes where they really cross the line and made it too goofy. Yet again it was naive at the moments, and some dialogue could be better but Overall its quite enjoyable movie, one of the best marvel have to offer for now.","[['first movie', 'everyone', 'the story', 'nothing', 'same problem', 'forgettable villain', 'marvel', 'movies.Now', 'Vol', 'this time', 'good job', 'much fun', 'the set', 'Visauls', 'story', 'humor'], ['Plot', 'the job'], ['villain', 'well.On', 'the other hand', 'The problem', 'movie', 'the whole time', 'the line'], ['some dialogue', 'Overall', 'quite', 'enjoyable movie', 'marvel']]","[['first movie', 'everyone', 'story', 'characters', 'nothing', 'same problem', 'forgettable villain', 'marvel movies.Now', 'Vol', 'surprised me.Characters', 'depths', 'time', 'Actors', 'good job', 'much fun', 'set', 'Visauls', 'story', 'humor', 'few times'], ['Plot', 'movies', 'job'], ['villain', 'well.On', 'other hand', 'problem', 'movie', 'whole time', 'jokes', 'scenes', 'line'], ['moments', 'dialogue', 'Overall', 'quite', 'enjoyable movie', 'marvel']]"
176,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,James Gun holds strong by breaking the formula,This film is amazing in so many ways. This film does push away from some of the ensemble feel of the first one making this film not feel as strong as the first one did by giving more development to other areas in the world that Guardians inhabit. It is amazing what James Gun manages to accomplish in this film. In this short he has managed to capture all the most important parts of the original making it more interesting and dynamic. The first Guardians of the Galaxy was pretty much a 10 for me. I thought it was one of the funnest movies I had seen. Only being outdone by the Oscar wining film known as Birdman (which I watch once ever year). It is very naturally written and paced also extremely well. It was such a great film that was always going to be nearly impossible to outdo. And in some ways it is better. Vol 2 manages to give development to one of the lesser characters in the last film known as Yondu Making him a lot more interesting and a lot more dynamic as well. You come to care foe Yondu as a person. The relationship between Peter and his father is also very well done and has a lot of heart. And for the first time ever the Marvel movies actually manage to make a really amazing and captivating villain who matters!! This film also has a legitimate death in it. James Gun has done it people. He has broken the Marvel formula!!!Sadly it is still to the defeat of the ensemble feel of the first one as the rest of the cast while still great and fun aren't being as highlighted as they were in the first one. The jokes are more like Age of Ultron jokes with a few being really funny. And the final act of the film feels like every superhero movie ever. Overall though Guardians of the Galaxy is still a fun movie that you will still very much enjoy despite some of its flaws.,"[['This film'], ['This film', 'the ensemble feel', 'this film', 'development', 'the world', 'inhabit'], ['James Gun', 'this film'], [], ['Galaxy'], [], ['Oscar', 'wining', 'film', 'Birdman', 'year'], [], ['a great film'], [], ['Vol', 'development', 'the last film', 'Yondu Making', 'a lot', 'a lot'], ['Yondu', 'a person'], ['The relationship', 'Peter', 'father', 'a lot', 'heart'], ['the first time', 'Marvel', 'villain'], ['This film', 'a legitimate death'], ['James Gun'], ['Marvel', 'formula'], ['the defeat', 'the ensemble feel', 'the first one', 'the rest', 'the cast', 'fun', 'the first one'], ['Age', 'Ultron'], ['the final act', 'the film', 'every superhero', 'movie'], ['Galaxy', 'a fun', 'movie', 'much enjoy']]","[['film', 'many ways'], ['film', 'ensemble feel', 'film', 'development', 'other areas', 'world', 'inhabit'], ['James Gun', 'film'], ['important parts'], ['first Guardians', 'Galaxy'], ['movies'], ['Oscar wining film', 'Birdman', 'year'], [], ['great film'], ['ways'], ['Vol', 'manages', 'development', 'characters', 'last film', 'Yondu Making', 'lot', 'lot'], ['foe Yondu', 'person'], ['relationship between Peter', 'father', 'lot of heart'], ['first time', 'Marvel movies', 'villain'], ['film', 'legitimate death'], ['James Gun', 'people'], ['Marvel formula'], ['defeat', 'ensemble feel', 'first one', 'rest', 'cast', 'fun', 'first one'], ['jokes', 'Age of Ultron jokes'], ['final act', 'film feels', 'superhero movie'], ['Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'fun movie', 'much enjoy', 'flaws']]"

I am not a purist or am I a hipster that likes to judge every aspect of a movie. Character development, plot and what ever else other reviews like to say when they don't like a movie. To me it looked like the actors had a blast making this movie. They worked well together. Rooker, Russell and Batista all have big roles in which they shined in many scenes. I like to have fun and that's what GOTG2 was all about. It was a fun movie from start to finish to end credit scene... again and again. I love it in so many ways. The way I look at it, was it entertaining did it fill you with excitement or bring out true emotions. For me that was a absolute yes. I want to go see the movie again, because there was so much to take in but just to see baby Groot's facial expressions and laugh out loud again, makes it all worth it.

178,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Intergalactic fun ride filled with emotions,"Marvel successfully introduced their lesser known comic book characters with the Guardians of the Galaxy in 2014. It went on to become a blockbuster and also was highly appreciated by the critics. Following its predecessor's success, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 released with much higher expectations than the first part. Director James Gunn not only manages to live up to the expectations and delivers a near perfect fantasy adventure. After saving Xandar, the Guardians of the Galaxy continue to work as a team and are on a mission to protect the valuable batteries of Sovereign race from an interdimensional monster. After the successful mission, team ends up being attacked by the Sovereign due to Rocket's misadventures. During their escape they encounter Peter Quill's father who takes them to the planet Ego to reveal his origins and his purpose. While Quill and Gamora fight their own personal battles, Rocket, Drax and Groot end up making new allies and strengthen their bonds. The movie is about how Guardians work together again as a team (or should we say family) for saving the Galaxy, again. Vol. 2 is a bit different and more emotional than the first movie. It is also not short of any humour as promised in the trailer. Once again the choice of music is on point which almost make this movie seem as a musical even in intense action sequences. The visual effects are handled brilliantly just like any other Marvel movie. Funny one liners, stupid humour and loads of cuteness with everyone's favorite character Baby Groot makes this movie an enjoyable experience for all age groups. The movie seems a bit out of place in certain scenes, but apart from that it is thoroughly enjoyable.Chris Pratt as Peter Quill has a meaty role in this one as the story revolves around him. While Zoe Saldana and many others cakewalk through their roles, it is Dave Bautista as Drax who steals the show with his funny act. The character if Drax the destroyer has taken a U turn compared to what it was in the first part. Dave Bautista sidelines the fellow funny character Rocket which was the show stealer in the first movie. The character Baby Groot has been so well written and executed so that it is impossible to hate. Even the Ravagers in the movie find it, ""Too adorable to kill"". While veteran actor Kurt Russel plays Ego, Quill's father, Michael Rooker as Yondu has a very significant role as well.

179,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Can you catch lightning twice?,"I think that when you have such a phenomenon like Guardians of The Galaxy it is really hard to duplicate its awesomeness, it's almost like catching lightning in a bottle, and the attempt to do it again without exploding. And that's why with a few exceptions most movie sequels tend to suck. Now, this movie didn't suck, in fact it was pretty good!And, tho the first act was a bit prolonged it laid the foundations to one of the greatest story lines I have seen in Comic Book Movies as of yet, James Gunn takes us to a journey where he is not afraid to show us the silly and incredibly side of the Comic Books. A couple of easter eggs will take your breath away, but the story line is really smart and remarkably emotional at times, this felt almost as a conclusion to GoTG so I can't dare to think what the hell are they going to do for Guardians of The Galaxy Vol 3.As you can see I'm not talking about the plot, and I'm not going to do so as I would not want to rob you from the roller coaster of emotions you are bound to experience when watching this outstanding movie, but I will say this: You thought they turned Comic Book Movies ""grounded"" feeling upside down in the first one with a walking tree and a gun wielding raccoon? Just wait to see what they do with a character called ""Ego the Living Planet.""Was it as good as the first one? In all honesty it was probably not, but it did not disappoint either.

James Gunn knows how to enthral his audience. He shoots for fun and delivers it with style. It's structure fumbles, but collectively, is pretty unconventional. Which for a blockbuster is always a welcome. Where the 'Space Avengers' are lacking this time around, is in it's humour and it's character's emotional arks/developments, that made the first so heart warming. There are plenty of laughs, don't be fooled. The best come from the always dependable Rocket and Groot relationship. With Yondu of all characters, playing a part in the duo's (and perhaps the movies) biggest laugh. However, many jokes just don't land. It doesn't stifle the fun, but you may wish for a few more fresher yuks in the script. Along side that are the character motivations, which are often unconvincing and sometimes, unearned. One too many, sentimental back-story beats, that feel forced more than poignant, lower the drama. There's nothing here to match Quills relationship with his mother's final gift.Nevertheless. The team are a delight to watch, all involved are clearly having a blast (allowing us to have a blast with them) and with vol. 3 in the cards, this could prove to be one of the Marvel franchise's best trilogies.","[['The team', 'no shortage', 'confidence', 'creativity'], ['James Gunn', 'audience'], ['fun', 'style'], ['structure'], ['Which', 'a blockbuster', 'a welcome'], [""the 'Space"", 'Avengers', 'this time', 'character', 'heart', 'warming'], ['plenty'], ['come', 'Rocket', 'Groot', 'relationship'], ['Yondu', 'a part', 'the duo', 'laugh'], [], ['the fun', 'fresher yuks', 'the script'], ['side', 'the character'], ['poignant', 'the drama'], ['nothing', 'Quills', 'relationship', 'mother', 'final gift.Nevertheless'], ['The team', 'a blast', 'a blast', 'vol'], ['Marvel', 'franchise']]","[['team', 'shortage in confidence', 'creativity'], ['James Gunn', 'audience'], ['fun and delivers', 'style'], ['structure fumbles'], ['Which', 'blockbuster', 'welcome'], [""'Space Avengers"", 'time', 'character', 'emotional arks/developments', 'heart warming'], ['plenty of laughs'], ['come', 'dependable Rocket', 'Groot relationship'], ['Yondu', 'characters', 'part', 'duo', 'movies', 'laugh'], ['many jokes'], ['fun', 'fresher yuks', 'script'], ['side', 'character motivations'], ['sentimental back-story beats', 'poignant', 'drama'], ['nothing', 'Quills relationship', 'mother', 'final gift.Nevertheless'], ['team', 'blast', 'blast', 'vol'], ['cards', 'Marvel franchise', 'trilogies']]"

Because of this, I expected this movie to be that way too.To an extent, I was pretty pleasantly surprised by the movie. The characters held the same charm that they did in the original movie with the heroes being flawed yet still very lovable. The movie gives our main character Starlord some more depth, which is something that I really appreciated. Somehow, I found the new Baby Groot even more charming than Groot from the original film. He provides the comedy and gives some of the more intense scenes such as the intro a more light hearted feel. The movie has a lot of funny moments. The Awesome Mix was also really good with many great classic songs as well.If there's one complaint I have with this movie, it's that it wasn't quite as fresh as the original Guardians of the Galaxy, as it holds a heavy focus on the relationship between Starlord and Ego.

185,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 2,"Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 2, directed, once again, by James Gunn, wasn't quite the breath of fresh air the first installment was, but it still packed a nice punch! James Gunn brings back his unorthodox style to this film, not paying off as well as the first, but still stands out as one of the better films of the MCU. I enjoyed Gunn's approach, by making this a grounded, character driven sequel, while also keeping the first addition in continuity, but by doing that, he created one too many subplots, leaving some things a little underdeveloped and choppy. Gunn utilized the same tones as the first film, while also recharging that emotional tone, but he seemed to try to throw in an extra dose of humor, and it threw the tones off in most occasions. One issue this film had that the first film didn't, was it's pace. For almost the entire first act, it was tough to see where things were going; it just felt like another Guardians film. When the second act hits, that's when it slows down, but we get great layers to all of our main characters. When the final act hits, that's where it starts to feel like a Marvel film, having big action sequences, and great chemistry between the characters.One of the best things that James Gunn did for this film, was not only flesh out all of the characters, but give them such a grounded tone, being able to mesh with the other Avengers seamlessly. With this film being centered around Chris Pratt as Peter Quill, again, we were able to dig deeper into his back story, and discover a lot of great layers to his character. He had so much to do, carrying the load on his shoulders, leaving him with the best character arch of the film. Zoe Sladana returns as Gamora, and she absolutely kills it this time! With her character being involved with a drastic plot point, it left her character to be fleshed out more, while becoming more grounded than before. Karen Gillan as Nebula got a lot more to do this time around, really giving herself, and Gamora the extra excitement and importance they both needed. We really didn't get too much more on Drax, played by Dave Bautista, but every time that man opens his mouth, it's comedy gold! With the nice addition of Mantis, played by Pom Klementieff, it helped flesh his character out, subtly. Michael Rooker as Yondu, is the MAN! He gets so much more to do this time around, fleshing his character out nicely. His character is just so well written, allowing for great character moments. With Groot being pushed to the side, it allowed for Rocket Racoon, played by Bradley Cooper, to gain a tremendous bond with Yondu. The banter between these two characters was absolutely gut-busting! Rocket also has one of the better character archs of the film, fleshing his character out more, while keeping that charm everyone loves. I'm a fan of Kurt Russell, and I really liked him in the MCU, but the writters didn't give him enough space to breath, and be Kurt Russell. Even though he has one of the best back stories for a villain, while also posing a real threat, his character development was predictable. If James Gunn let him do his thing, I feel as if this film could've benefited from that Kurt Russell charisma. The issue this film had, it tried too incorporate too many villains, making everyone underdeveloped, and a waste of potential.Guardians 2 didn't rely on the action like the first film, but the few times it's there, it's super exciting, well shot, and backed up with immaculate effects. This is one of the MCU's best looking films.You didn't think that they would make a sequel and not absolutely kill it on the soundtrack again, did you? James Gunn and Tyler Bates came together once more to create another amazing soundtrack, that enhanced the emotion and tention in each scene.Overall, even though James Gunn ran into a few more issues than the first, he still managed to create a real fun experience!","[['Galaxy', 'Volume', 'James Gunn', 'the breath', 'fresh air', 'the first installment', 'a nice punch'], ['James Gunn', 'unorthodox style', 'this film', 'MCU'], ['Gunn', 'approach', 'sequel', 'the first addition', 'continuity'], ['Gunn', 'the first film', 'emotional tone', 'an extra dose', 'humor'], ['issue', 'this film', 'the first film', 'pace'], ['the entire first act', 'Guardians', 'film'], ['the second act'], ['the final act', 'Marvel', 'film', 'big action', 'great chemistry', 'the characters.One', 'James Gunn', 'this film', 'a grounded tone', 'Avengers'], ['this film', 'Chris Pratt', 'Peter Quill', 'deeper', 'back story', 'a lot', 'character'], ['the load', 'character', 'arch', 'the film'], ['Zoe Sladana', 'Gamora', 'this time'], ['character', 'a drastic plot', 'point', 'character'], ['Karen Gillan', 'Nebula', 'a lot', 'this time', 'Gamora', 'the extra excitement', 'importance'], ['Drax', 'Dave Bautista', 'every time', 'man', 'mouth', 'comedy gold'], ['the nice addition', 'Mantis', 'Pom Klementieff', 'character'], ['Michael Rooker', 'Yondu', 'the MAN'], ['this time', 'character'], ['character', 'great character'], ['Groot', 'the side', 'Rocket Racoon', 'Bradley Cooper', 'a tremendous bond', 'Yondu'], ['The banter'], ['Rocket', 'character', 'archs', 'the film', 'character', 'charm', 'everyone'], ['a fan', 'Kurt Russell', 'MCU', 'space', 'Kurt Russell'], ['back', 'a villain', 'a real threat', 'character', 'development'], ['James Gunn', 'thing', 'this film', 'Kurt Russell', 'charisma'], ['The issue', 'this film', 'everyone', 'a waste', 'the action', 'the first film', 'super exciting', 'shot'], ['MCU', 'films.You', 'a sequel', 'the soundtrack'], ['James Gunn', 'Tyler Bates', 'another amazing soundtrack', 'the emotion', 'tention', 'each scene.Overall', 'James Gunn', 'a real fun', 'experience']]","[['Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'Volume', 'James Gunn', 'breath', 'fresh air', 'first installment', 'nice punch'], ['James Gunn', 'unorthodox style', 'film', 'films', 'MCU'], ['Gunn', 'approach', 'sequel', 'addition in continuity', 'many subplots', 'things'], ['Gunn', 'same tones', 'first film', 'emotional tone', 'dose of humor', 'tones', 'occasions'], ['issue', 'film', 'first film', 'pace'], ['entire first act', 'things', 'Guardians film'], ['act hits', 'great layers', 'main characters'], ['act hits', 'Marvel film', 'action sequences', 'great chemistry', 'characters.One', 'things', 'James Gunn', 'film', 'characters', 'grounded tone', 'other Avengers'], ['film', 'Chris Pratt', 'Peter Quill', 'deeper', 'back story', 'lot', 'great layers', 'character'], ['load', 'shoulders', 'character arch', 'film'], ['Zoe Sladana', 'Gamora', 'time'], ['character', 'plot point', 'character'], ['Karen Gillan', 'Nebula', 'lot', 'time', 'Gamora', 'extra excitement and importance'], ['Drax', 'Dave Bautista', 'time', 'man', 'mouth', 'comedy gold'], ['addition of Mantis', 'Pom Klementieff', 'character'], ['Michael Rooker', 'Yondu', 'MAN'], ['time', 'character'], ['character', 'character moments'], ['Groot', 'side', 'Rocket Racoon', 'Bradley Cooper', 'bond with Yondu'], ['banter', 'characters'], ['Rocket', 'character archs', 'film', 'character', 'charm everyone'], ['fan of Kurt Russell', 'MCU', 'writters', 'space', 'Kurt Russell'], ['back stories', 'villain', 'real threat', 'character development'], ['James Gunn', 'thing', 'film', 'Kurt Russell charisma'], ['issue', 'film', 'many villains', 'everyone', 'waste of potential.Guardians', 'action', 'first film', 'few times', 'super exciting', 'shot', 'immaculate effects'], ['MCU', 'films.You', 'sequel', 'soundtrack'], ['James Gunn', 'Tyler Bates', 'amazing soundtrack', 'emotion and tention', 'scene.Overall', 'James Gunn', 'issues', 'fun experience']]"
186,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"a great, entertaining sequel to a great movie","I had my doubts about this one while going to the cinema, because I am a big fan of the first one and was genuinely worried that this one wouldn't live up to it's predecessor. While I do believe that the first one was a better movie, this one is what I would consider a perfect sequel. Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 does the right thing by letting us get to know the characters a bit better. What I was most surprised by, however, was the choice to focus more on the character of Yondu than that of Chris Pratt's Star Lord. I thought it was a brilliant choice; Michael Rooker really shines in this role and is by far the best character in the movie. There are also some really cool action scenes with his arrow. Star Lord gets thrown to the side a bit, which is good since we already know pretty much everything about him except for who his dad is, which we do find out in this movie. All in all, the action was fun, the characters were great, the colors were great, it was much funnier than the first one (this movie is very much a comedy with some absolutely hilarious one-liners, mostly from Drax) and just overall a delightful experience. It definitely exceeded my expectations. That being said, I do have just a few problems with this movie. They don't ruin the movie for me and they're not that bothersome, but still. We all know about the recent trend in big superhero movies such as this one, which is bad villains. And, honestly, all of my problems start with the villains. The Guardians are being followed throughout the movie by these golden people, which ultimately serve no purpose in the movie other than being ""villains"", I guess. I say ""villains"" because it's very much debatable what their motivations are and even who they are, and we just don't know enough about them to care. Everything they do is pretty ridiculous and over the top. The other problem I have is with Kurt Russel's character. Now, I love Kurt Russel and I was excited to see him play Peter Quill's dad, but his character just feels like a big exposition machine and, not to get too spoilery, goes the typical cliché route. His motivations are clear, but very much overused and he's basically in the movie as a plot device. These two things, though, aren't that big of a problem to me because they were just devices for the movie to give Star Lord something to do (of course, a movie needs conflict), and they were background things working around the jokes, fun, and the adventure the characters we love were on. And the ending does get quite emotional.Ultimately, I think fans of the first movie will have no problems enjoying this one as well and I believe it has done everything right as a sequel. Let's just hope Marvel continues down this path of movies that know what they are and are just plain fun.","[['while', 'the cinema', 'a big fan', 'this one', 'predecessor'], ['the first one', 'movie', 'a perfect sequel'], ['Galaxy', 'vol'], ['the right thing'], ['the choice', 'the character', 'Yondu', 'Chris Pratt', 'Star Lord'], ['a brilliant choice', 'Michael Rooker', 'this role', 'character', 'the movie'], ['cool action', 'arrow'], ['Star Lord', 'the side', 'a bit', 'much everything', 'dad', 'this movie'], ['the action', 'fun', 'the first one', 'this movie', 'a comedy', 'Drax', 'a delightful experience'], [], ['this movie'], ['the movie', 'bothersome'], ['the recent trend', 'big superhero'], [], ['the movie', 'no purpose', 'the movie'], [], ['Everything'], ['The other problem', 'Kurt Russel', 'character'], ['Kurt Russel', 'Peter Quill', 'dad', 'character', 'a big exposition', 'machine', 'the typical cliché', 'route'], ['the movie', 'a plot', 'device'], ['a problem', 'the movie', 'Star Lord', 'something', 'course', 'a movie', 'conflict', 'fun', 'the adventure'], ['the first movie', 'this one', 'everything', 'right', 'a sequel'], ['Marvel', 'this path', 'fun']]","[['doubts', 'while', 'cinema', 'big fan', 'one', 'predecessor'], ['first one', 'movie', 'perfect sequel'], ['Guardians', 'Galaxy vol'], ['right thing', 'characters'], ['choice', 'character of Yondu', 'Chris Pratt', 'Star Lord'], ['brilliant choice', 'Michael Rooker', 'role', 'character', 'movie'], ['action scenes', 'arrow'], ['Star Lord', 'side', 'bit', 'much everything', 'dad', 'movie'], ['action', 'fun', 'characters', 'colors', 'first one', 'movie', 'comedy', 'hilarious one-liners', 'Drax', 'delightful experience'], ['expectations'], ['few problems', 'movie'], ['movie', 'bothersome'], ['recent trend', 'superhero movies', 'bad villains'], ['problems', 'villains'], ['Guardians', 'movie', 'golden people', 'purpose', 'movie', 'villains'], ['villains', 'motivations'], ['Everything'], ['other problem', 'Kurt Russel', 'character'], ['Kurt Russel', 'Peter Quill', 'dad', 'character', 'feels', 'exposition machine', 'cliché route'], ['motivations', 'movie', 'plot device'], ['things', 'problem', 'devices', 'movie', 'Star Lord something', 'course', 'movie', 'conflict', 'things', 'jokes', 'fun', 'adventure', 'characters'], ['fans', 'first movie', 'problems', 'one', 'everything right', 'sequel'], ['Marvel', 'path of movies', 'fun']]"
187,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" has a better plot and visuals and is even more fun than the original.","""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" (PG-13, 2:16), much like its predecessor, is one of the most creative movie mash-ups ever. When I reviewed the original, I noted how much it had in common with ""Star Wars"". My 2014 review called it, ""a movie about a group of rebels of different races getting together to save a planet from the power of a mysterious deadly orb,"" described the group as including ""a good-looking outlaw pilot who is used to only thinking of himself, a large brown creature who makes sounds that others seem to understand as a sort of language, a tough woman with a royal background who has no patience for nonsense and a small, wise creature who provides guidance to the others."" To all that, add significant daddy issues and you have the Guardians films. Well, plus aspects of ""Star Trek"" (discovering strange new worlds), ""Independence Day"" (several people playing crucial roles in defeating interstellar evil) and even ""The Fast and the Furious"" (a diverse group of friends regarded as family).And let's not forget that Guardians is a Marvel property. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" is the 15th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The movie contains Easter eggs tying it to other Marvel film franchises and hints at future cinematic overlap. In terms of how this one fits with the others chronologically, according to IMDb, ""the film takes place in 2014, 3 months after Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). It takes place a year after Thor: The Dark World (2013). Before or after Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) and a year before Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)."" Speaking of Tony Stark's cohorts, shortly before the first Guardians movie was released, Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger said that the goal with this franchise was actually to create ""another Avengers"". The Guardian series does have that feel to it, along with some of the comic sensibilities of ""Deadpool"", another Marvel film franchise born in the mid-2010s. Now, having said all that (and ensuing cinematic cross-pollination notwithstanding), the Guardians movies have definitely created their own niche within the MCU – and their own sense of fun.Picking up just months after the action in the original, ""Vol. 2"" sees Peter Quill / Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) adjusting to their newfound fame, their role as galaxy guardians and the dynamics of (and their individual places within) this team – slash – family unit. Early on, four of them battle a monster known as the Abilisk (looking like a much bigger and angrier Jabba the Hutt – with tentacles) while Groot dances to Quill's music. A gold-colored race of people known as the Sovereign reward the Guardians for defeating Abilisk – and protecting the special batteries that it was trying to steal – by turning over a prisoner, Nebula (Karen Gillan), Gamora's estranged sister, who has a bounty on her head. As the Guardians leave the Sovereign, Rocket steals some of those valuable batteries. The insult of such a theft sends Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki) into a rage and she sends her fleet of remotely-piloted drones after Rocket and company. Due to some nifty flying – and a little help from a mysterious ship which suddenly comes to their aid – the Guardians survive, but crash land on an unfamiliar planet.That mysterious ship lands on the planet too and out steps a being called Ego (Kurt Russell) who claims to be Quill's father! Ego's story seems to check out, so Quill, Gamora and Drax let Ego take them back to his planet so Quill can spend some time with his pops. Rocket is left behind to repair the ship, take care of Baby Groot and keep an eye on Nebula. As Quill and friends get to know Ego – and Mantis (Pom Klementieff), Ego's pet empath (a being who can experience the feelings of other people by touching them and even temporarily alter those feelings), Rocket has to defend against an attack by Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker) and his crew of Ravegers, whom Ayesha has hired to retrieve the batteries and kill the Guardians. The Ravegers capture Rocket and Groot, but Yondu's reluctance to pursue Quill leads to a mutiny by Yondu's crew. His lieutenant, who calls himself Taserface (Chris Sullivan), imprisons Yondu, Rocket and Groot, gets rid of those loyal to Yondu and teams up with Nebula to catch up with the rest of the Guardians, who, in the meantime, have run into some pretty serious trouble of their own.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" has a better plot and visuals and is even more fun than the original. In the first movie, the Guardians became a family, but in this one, they have to learn how to BE a family – while Quill and Gamora each have to deal with serious conflicts stemming from their own original families. Freed from the confines of establishing the Guardians' cinematic world and forming their relationships gives returning writer/director James Gunn the freedom to do more interesting things with the story – and the characters, which are now more developed – and more entertaining – especially Groot, who's as adorable as any Minion, but much tougher (which also happens to be pretty adorable). The music is great, while the scenery is vibrant and the action is exciting (and deserving of 3D viewing). Sometimes, there's almost too much going on visually, but also aurally, as the sound effects and music compete for attention with the dialog. As a whole, Vol. 2 is a good step forward for the franchise and (with help from five short scenes and embedded graphics during and after the closing credits) builds anticipation for more Guardian adventures, including some Marvel-ous crossover action.

189,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"Great humor, poor villain","The Guardians of the Galaxy are back at it. Who would have known that the existence of life would be protected, once again, by a group of idiots.This was one of the funniest movies put out by Marvel. Baby Groot had me laughing the entire time. He was unpredictable in his actions. His conversations were intriguing. His dancing was creative and entertaining.Drax the Destroyer, played by Dave Batista, could not have been any more literal with his presence. He was not as uptight as he was in the first installment of Guardians of the Galaxy. This made him more appealing in a comedic fashion, and it was awesome!The story started off in such a powerful way, it made me think that the rest of the movie was going to build to a monumental finish. But unfortunately, that was not the case. After the main opening scene, the rest of the movie did not match the benchmark that was set earlier. The way the middle of the movie was put together, it made the villain unclear in regards to who he or she was. Ego the Living Planet, played by Kurt Russell, was not as good of a villain as what should have been present in the movie. In the first Guardians of the Galaxy, Ronan the Accuser was an incredible and suitable challenge for the Guardians of the Galaxy. Although Ego the Living Planet is more powerful than Ronan the Accuser, his presence in the movie was weak and it did not leave an impact like it should have. I believe if Ego the Living Planet could have been introduced much better, and he could have been a greater threat to the Guardians of the Galaxy to make for a better story.Despite my disagreement with Ego the Living Planet's role in the movie, the rest was suitable. Overall, this is still a good movie to see.","[['Galaxy'], ['the existence', 'life', 'a group', 'idiots.This', 'Marvel'], ['Baby Groot', 'the entire time'], [], [], ['dancing', 'Destroyer', 'Dave Batista', 'presence'], ['the first installment', 'Galaxy'], ['a comedic fashion', 'The story', 'a powerful way', 'the rest', 'the movie', 'a monumental finish'], ['the case'], ['the main opening', 'scene', 'the rest', 'the movie', 'the benchmark'], ['The way', 'the middle', 'the movie', 'the villain'], ['Ego', 'Living Planet', 'Kurt Russell', 'a villain', 'the movie'], ['Galaxy', 'Ronan', 'Accuser', 'suitable challenge', 'Galaxy'], ['Ego', 'Living Planet', 'Ronan', 'Accuser', 'presence', 'the movie', 'an impact'], ['Ego', 'Living Planet', 'threat', 'Galaxy', 'disagreement', 'Ego', 'Living Planet', 'role', 'the movie', 'the rest'], ['a good movie']]","[['Guardians', 'Galaxy'], ['existence of life', 'group of idiots.This', 'movies', 'Marvel'], ['Baby Groot', 'entire time'], ['actions'], ['conversations'], ['dancing', 'Destroyer', 'Dave Batista', 'presence'], ['installment of Guardians', 'Galaxy'], ['comedic fashion', 'story', 'powerful way', 'rest', 'movie', 'monumental finish'], ['case'], ['opening scene', 'rest', 'movie', 'benchmark'], ['way', 'middle', 'movie', 'villain', 'regards'], ['Ego', 'Living Planet', 'Kurt Russell', 'villain', 'movie'], ['first Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'Ronan', 'Accuser', 'suitable challenge', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy'], ['Ego', 'Living Planet', 'Ronan', 'Accuser', 'presence', 'movie', 'impact'], ['Ego', 'Living Planet', 'threat', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'disagreement with Ego', 'Living Planet', 'role', 'movie', 'rest'], ['good movie']]"

191,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"Solid, but not as good as the first","James Gunn once helms the Guardians of the Galaxy's ship as well as once again writing the screenplay. After the success of the first film one might be forgiven that this was a good move. I would have agreed, except that for a variety of reasons the magic is slightly missing in this sequel which just doesn't quite manage to lift itself up to the lofty heights of it's predecessor or some other Marvel films.The outline here is a lot more insipid and story-driven that the first offering we got from Gunn and for that I feel it does suffer for it. We once again start in eighties (nineteen-eighty to be precise) where we see a very young Kurt Russell with Meredith (as we know to be Peter's mother). He takes her to look at an unusual flower he has planted in the woods telling her of stories and dreams for the future.Thirty-four years later (and set six months after the first film) our merry band of misfit hero's are battling an interdimensional 'beast' while baby Groot dances to Mr Blue Sky by the wonderful Jeff Lynne (ELO), completely oblivious to the fight. They are there to collect an important object in order to see justice done (and collect a lot of booty in the process).Unfortunately the loveable rogue raccoon Rocket just can't help himself or his sticky fingers. This (unfortunately for our guardians) leads to the Golden High Priestess Ayesha of the Sovereign launching a full scale assault against them, forcing them to crash land on another planet. This is where we meet Ego (Russell) as he lands to rescue them having been searching for Peter for years.Meanwhile the Ravagers are at a stip bar (with Howard the Duck in a ridiculous scene) and yes I did just say that, where Yondu is having issues with another Ravager leader (Stallone). Fortune favours the brave though as they say and the Golden Priestess offeres Yondu some redemption by hiring him and his own equal band of misfits to hunt down the Guardians.Those are all really just side issues though. Unfortunately the film dwells on nothingness for far too long and takes an age (almost ninety minutes) to get to the actual main plot. Everything leading up to that is filler (very good filler mind at times) but filler nontheless. Onve this main story starts the film really does slow down to a snails pace and I feel that this is where it starts to go wrong. For ninety minutes you have a film very similar to the first. Then it all gets a little sidetracked and wayward.We get to meet Peter's father who is millions of years old and birthed from the stars and cosmos itself. He also created his own planet and...well...is also a little crazy. I guess loneliness can do that if you're an ego-maniacal space God intent on universal control. Regardless, the visual aspects of the second part of the film are very impressive but the story does drag. Russell is also not at his best and does his best Jeff Bridges impression, funny how similar those two have become in their acting over the last few years. In fact, his character is just not that interesting despite the fact he should be.Once again everyones acting is excellent here and certainly in the earlier parts of the film the laughs run freely. The entire scene where Groot helps Yondu is just pure comedy gold and Rocket still has an unnerving fascination for wanting other peoples mechanical body parts. As impressive as he was in the first, Drax has definitely grown as a character and is also brilliant, finding humour in many things with his raucous laughter.We also get to see much more of Gamora's sister Nebula this time too and the film does benefit from having her presence. certainly an excellent and interesting character and I'm glad she got more screen time compared to the first film. Pom Klementieff does a good job asa a naive empath though she is not really around enough to make a lasting impression. Likewise the classy Laura Haddock has a little more to do this time as Meredith, though her talents are wasted for the role.Just like in the first film, everything looks fantastic and there is some beautiful visual effects to go along with the fantastic soundtrack which has perfect song placement. The highlight of the entire film though has to be baby Groot, he is so adorable and even more fun this time around. With the best credits sequence of any film yet in the universe this is not a bad offering but does fail to meet its expectations. Just be sure to remember your metaphors.

194,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Hooked on the Guardians,"The Guardians are back and they surely do not disappoint.The MCU creates an emotional,really entertaining and important film.It is not as good as the first one,but deserves to be watched.Just imagine Baby Groot dancing like crazy while the other members are trying to fight a huge monster in one of the first scenes.How better can it get?One thing that I really liked in this film is that it is deeper that the first and has an emotional tone,something that we rarely see in superhero films.It shows the real meaning of family and friendship and emphasizes on team work and sacrifice.It makes the audience move to tears and feel the particular film.The soundtrack was PERFECT!I loved Mr.Blue Sky,The Chain,Fox on the Run,Father and Son!It was energetic and it was combined perfectly with the scenes.Another advantage of the film was the character development.Yondu/Mary Poppins was maybe the best character of the film,because he was funny,cool and at the end proved that he's is a hero and a great daddy!Star Lord and Rocket were cool.Gamora and Nebula developed a great relationship with each other.Dax was really cool!He was funny,emotional and did exactly what he needed to do as a character.Baby Groot was really entertaining and cute,but he could have had a more important role in this film.Mantis,one of the new characters had a clever power and I liked the way they designed her look.The only character that I did not particularly liked was Ego,Star-Lord's Father.He was not the appropriate villain for the film and the idea that he was a planet and person at the same time was clever but over-fleshed.Except from Ego's character,I thought that the plot was a little weak and that the Guardian's story was less important than the first one.Although it had a great introduction and the movie included a lot of impressive action scenes,the story did not fully capture the guardian's greatness.The film provides great humor,touching scenes,cool characters and it has the same style as the first one.I especially liked the emotional ending.A perfect funeral.Fireworks all around the galaxy.Father and Son.How can you not cry?All in all,the guardians strike back in a powerful way and they do not only kick butt.They show to us that when we drop the ego whether it's our personal ego or our crazy planet god father named Ego then we can learn to value life and be with the more important things that could already be standing right next to us.

195,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Escapist entertainment at its worst,"Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is like The Avengers: Age of Ultron. After a spectacular, wonderful first film, it becomes a formulaic mess! Again, the movie opens by a scene which our heroes are threw into a mission for no reason and they are in danger, so they fight against an unknown enemy without building an introduction or tension. Just pure audiovisual joy. That's the key word to describe this movie: pure joy, but nothing else. We had high expectations and expected the movie to be greater than the first, but instead it was a total mess. The star of this movie is baby Groot but he is too cute. The mature Groot in the first movie was naturally funny and intimidating at the same time, here everybody tries to be amusing. The sentimentality in some scenes feel superficial. I just didn't buy it. Kurt Russell and Sylvester Stallone are cast in the same movie together years after Tango and Cash for the first time which is a historic moment, but they never come across during the movie. What??? The villain of the movie makes no sense and there is a relationship between the villain's motivation and Peter Quill's past, but why do you dig for the stories which were perfectly built in the first movie? What is wrong with you? We were exposed to the same forced sentimentality and story being tied to another story in the latest sequel of The Pirates of the Caribbean. Maybe, the most annoying relationship in the movie is between two sisters. It was ridiculous. I almost couldn't endure watching this character and her relationship with her sister, because it looks fake. It is just a plot device. The movie recalls the movie Zardoz which is nice, little Greek tragedy and definitely the best part of the movie is trying to escape from space prison part, but oh man, this was a total mess! Even the post credit scenes were boring and uninteresting. In the second half, we watch action, action and more action until we become mentally tired! The team has ""we are a family"" message for you like Fast and Furious movies and as said before, the movie is very similar with its poster: a complete audiovisual mess! Lots of CGI, lots of noisy action and overblown visuals with no properly built up story, no development, no tension and no heart and soul. By the way, like most of the movies in these days, the villain explains everything one by one, evil plans are included, to make everything clear for us at some point!

196,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,You can't beat a bit of ELO,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a fun sequel that builds on the first film. I was drawn in from the title sequence as Baby Groot dances to Mr Blue Sky as behind him a monster fight takes place.The focus is on Star Lord meeting his celestial father, Ego (Kurt Russell) living in his own planet and with a name like Ego you can immediately sense trouble.Yet we also have character development as well, the relationship between Star Lord and Gamora intensifies but we also see it develop between the warring sisters as Nebula turns up wanting sibling blood.We are also shone more light between Yondu and Star Lord, Yondu was supposed to deliver the infant Peter Quill to Ego but kept him for himself as he was small and thin, useful for some thieving. In fact Yondu gets the most character development here.Drax also gets to shine with more comical interludes with Rocket and new character Mantis. Baby Groot is fun as comic relief.The film soundtrack works in the context of the film with songs like Father and son (Cat Stevens) and The Chain (Fleetwood Mac.) There are even cameos from Sylvester Stallone and David Hasselhoff.Visually the film looks great, it is very much a knockabout adventure than a superhero film without being bloated or self indulgent as some of the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels.

197,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,How can anyone like this movie,"I give it a three but its more like 2.5ish, and I am being very generous. Its only because of the quality of special effects and baby Groot. That said, there is nothing in this movie to be excited about. Bad dialogues, bad dialogue delivery. Weird sense of timing on bad jokes. No Script whatsoever. I could stand the movie for abt 5 mins tops. Then I got bored. so I had to watch it in 5-10 mins intervals hoping it would get better but it didn't. The whole premise in the movie is a direct take over(COPY in lay Mans terms) from every space movie Hollywood has made. The scene where Kurt Russel explains his origins to StarLord seems directly taken from the MAN Of Steel, but seems very stupid. The Space creatures are Gross. The only feeling I had at times while watching it is a feeling of PUKE(As opposed to some users here who felt Joyous). Sly Stallone is wasted, Kurt Russell is stupidly wasted and I can go on and on.Marvel must really be paying a bomb to all those critics, Marvel Fans and IMDb credit dispatchers(One who give the stars) to give it such a good rating.All I see in this movie is a bunch of C***.

198,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Hooked on this feeling? The answer is Yes and with extra surprises,"I don't know if I like this one more or less than the first one. The story felt scaled down if you think about how ""Vol. 1"" was. Or maybe I shouldn't say scaled down. It was more centered on one thing. So, don't go in expecting a sequel that's more epic or just bigger/grander in general. Sure, the spectacle and the humor is still there. You will get your money's worth because of those things. But, the actual story line is a little different and not very common with these type of films. It might be disappointing for some or it might be great for others. I had a good time with it though.I wasn't expecting the movie to go to some places and the surprises were pretty good. I love the characters. Baby Groot was the one I wasn't completely sold on. I'm not the biggest fan of the idea that he is a baby in this one. Most of the jokes hit home, some minor ones felt a little too much. Don't worry, there are more good jokes than bad ones. I did laugh plenty of times. Drax was really good in this and so was Michael Rooker's Yondu. Chris Pratt delivers. He gets to have more of a dramatic role, but he still doesn't forget to have fun. I felt that Zoe Saldana's Gamora didn't stand out so much this time around. She was still playing the character well though. Mantis was one of the stand outs this time. The humor and charisma she brings to the table was fantastic. Stallone was underutilized. It was weird seeing him in it at first. It was like, ""What's he doing in this movie?"". But, he was fine as a supporting character. Now how was Kurt Russell? Well, I will not spoil anything, but he was pretty much Kurt Russell. Meaning he basically played himself. But, hey! It worked. The movie is already vibrant and funny enough that having Russell in it makes perfect sense.I admire the fact that James Gunn just goes for it and makes movies that feel personal. I like that it wasn't just entirely for the laughs and that there were some serious scenes. Most of them were good, because they dared to do some unexpected things. They also helped explore the characters even better. Although those serious/dramatic scenes usually followed up a scene that was ridiculous and fun, so the transition didn't feel smooth enough. I hope you understand what I mean. For example; We get a pop song and everyone's firing blasters and then the next second the music gets very melodramatic and someone is talking about sad feelings. What I'm trying to say is that the tones were very jumpy sometimes. There's of course the ""Fast & Furious"" thing about them stating they're a family. I didn't buy it actually. As friends? Yes, of course. But, saying they are a family is stretching it. That's probably my biggest negative. And the finale wasn't the greatest. I missed the presence of a lot of characters from the first movie. Maybe they'll show up in a sequel down the line.I may have worded this review out too much by now. I'm sorry about that. Basic point is that the Marvel Cinematic Universe hasn't hit a dead spot yet. They are still bringing us entertaining and surprisingly fresh stories. This is a pretty easy watch and the plus is that you might get some nice emotional parts here and there. Go in with a fresh mind. It's weird, I know.

199,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Nice,"Like its predecessor, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 benefits too much from the cast's charisma and dynamic soundtrack to support themselves. For my part, this is a little better than the first. The 2014 film, in my opinion, is very nice and the humor works, but there are some problems in the technical part of the production (the CGI is particularly mediocre) and some performances in the main group are not so good. For example, Chris Pratt, despite being a charismatic protagonist, in that movie sounded rather pedantic and one-note, with the music tossing and the comedic tirades, just like the Rocket. But here things are much sharper, I think that the space of 3 years between one and the other has benefited, it gave the actors time to find themselves better in their roles, and the track is less excessive. The space adventures of this group of misfits are not one of my favorites at MCU, but still, a good adventure.","[['predecessor', 'Galaxy Vol.2', 'the cast', 'charisma', 'dynamic soundtrack'], ['part'], ['film', 'opinion', 'the humor', 'the technical part', 'the production', 'CGI', 'the main group'], ['example', 'Chris Pratt', 'a charismatic protagonist', 'that movie', 'the music', 'tossing', 'Rocket'], ['the space', 'time', 'the track'], ['The space', 'this group', 'MCU', 'a good adventure']]","[['predecessor', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol.2 benefits', 'cast', 'charisma', 'dynamic soundtrack'], ['part'], ['film', 'opinion', 'humor', 'problems', 'technical part', 'production', 'CGI', 'performances', 'main group'], ['example', 'Chris Pratt', 'charismatic protagonist', 'movie', 'music tossing', 'comedic tirades', 'Rocket'], ['things', 'space', 'years', 'actors time', 'roles', 'track'], ['space', 'group of misfits', 'favorites at MCU', 'good adventure']]"

203,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Clearly the least impressive of the MCU movies so far,"I'm a huge Marvel fan and comics collector, and I basically love every single MCU movie. All of them have been rated at least 8 stars out of 10 by me (except ""The Incredible Hulk"", which was a 7 - and so was ""Captain America: Civil War"", which I had a number of problems with). The first GOTG movie was a visual feast, but it did have a weakness: the story wasn't strong. However, what it lacked in story it made up for in world-building, action and sheer visual spectacle and splendor.GOTGv2 sadly could not live up to the first movie, and at 4 stars it is, for me, the worst MCU movie yet. The main problem with it was its story: it barely had any. They meet Ego, he turns out to be a bad guy, and they fight him. That's the story. No particular nuances, no significant subplots, nothing much that made any kind of sense. It was this really thin story, and the rest of the movie was held together by gags (of very varying quality), clichés and no tape. Sure, there was a string of brief fan service moments, but that's not enough to make a movie good.In this movie I wanted to see more characters. I expected a crammed movie, but there were about *one* new character: Mantis, and she had very little to do. They spent too much time on Yondu, for the wrong reasons (not because the story demanded it, but because Rooker is such a respected actor), far too much time on his deadly arrow which got way over-used here (it should have been saved for a really important moment), and although the sibling rivalry between Gamora and Nebula was my favorite part of the movie, Gamora generally had a very tiny role and was almost reduced to a mere love interest.We didn't land on any interesting planets (besides Ego), and the universe was not expanded. Ego says he came into existence alone, but also says he is a Celestial. Sadly, we are not told what Celestials are and how he can be one of them and be a unique and lonely being at the same time. The golden people from The Sovereign were a bunch of one-track a-holes. Why would they want to kill the GOTG when they've just saved the galaxy (them included) from Ego? No, most of what was in this movie just made no sense at all. Such a shame. I also dislike much of the humor, because it is too vulgar. James Gunn clearly has the gutter-mind of a 9-year-old (and yeah, this was also a problem in the first movie. Joss Whedon has some of the blame, as he encouraged Gunn to put more of his own humorous taste in the movies).So, only 4 stars out of 10. Lots of things to look at, and several funny and touching moments. But, this is the tongue-in-cheek village idiot of the MCU, and I really wish it were more serious. In this sequel we basically just get more low-brow jokes, more guffaws from Drax, more distinctly unheroic sadism from Rocket, etc. We get more of what was popular in the first movie, but less of what actually worked.","[['Marvel', 'fan', 'collector', 'MCU', 'movie'], ['Hulk', 'Captain America', 'Civil War', 'a number'], ['GOTG', 'movie', 'a visual feast', 'a weakness', 'the story'], ['story', 'world-building', 'action', 'sheer', 'visual spectacle', 'splendor.GOTGv2', 'the first movie', 'MCU', 'movie'], ['The main problem', 'story'], ['Ego', 'a bad guy'], ['the story'], ['nothing', 'any kind', 'sense'], ['thin story', 'the rest', 'the movie', 'quality', 'clichés', 'no tape'], ['a string', 'brief fan service', 'a movie', 'good.In', 'this movie'], ['a crammed movie', '*', '*', 'new character', 'Mantis'], ['much time', 'Yondu', 'the story', 'Rooker', 'a respected actor', 'much time', 'deadly', 'arrow', 'way', 'important moment', 'rivalry', 'Gamora', 'Nebula', 'favorite part', 'the movie', 'Gamora', 'tiny role', 'a mere love', 'interest.We', 'Ego', 'the universe'], ['Ego', 'existence', 'Celestial'], ['Celestials', 'the same time'], ['Sovereign', 'a bunch'], ['GOTG', 'the galaxy', 'Ego'], ['this movie', 'no sense'], ['a shame'], ['the humor'], ['James Gunn', 'the gutter-mind', 'a problem', 'the first movie'], ['Joss Whedon', 'the blame', 'Gunn', 'own humorous taste', '.So'], [], ['the tongue-in-cheek village', 'idiot', 'MCU'], ['this sequel', 'Drax', 'unheroic sadism', 'Rocket', 'etc'], ['the first movie']]","[['Marvel fan', 'comics collector', 'MCU movie'], ['stars', 'Incredible Hulk', 'Captain America', 'Civil War', 'number of problems'], ['GOTG movie', 'visual feast', 'weakness', 'story'], ['story', 'world-building', 'action and sheer', 'visual spectacle and splendor.GOTGv2', 'first movie', 'stars', 'MCU movie'], ['main problem', 'story'], ['Ego', 'bad guy'], ['story'], ['particular nuances', 'significant subplots', 'nothing', 'kind of sense'], ['thin story', 'rest', 'movie', 'gags', 'quality', 'clichés', 'tape'], ['string', 'service moments', 'movie good.In', 'movie', 'characters'], ['crammed movie', '*', '*', 'new character', 'Mantis'], ['time on Yondu', 'wrong reasons', 'story', 'Rooker', 'respected actor', 'much time', 'deadly arrow', 'way', 'important moment', 'rivalry between Gamora', 'Nebula', 'favorite part', 'movie', 'Gamora', 'tiny role', 'love interest.We', 'interesting planets', 'Ego', 'universe'], ['Ego', 'existence', 'Celestial'], ['Celestials', 'same time'], ['golden people', 'Sovereign', 'bunch', 'one-track a-holes'], ['GOTG', 'galaxy', 'Ego'], ['movie', 'sense'], ['shame'], ['humor'], ['James Gunn', 'gutter-mind', 'problem', 'first movie'], ['Joss Whedon', 'blame', 'Gunn', 'own humorous taste', 'movies', '.So', 'stars'], ['Lots of things', 'several funny', 'moments'], ['village idiot', 'MCU'], ['sequel', 'low-brow jokes', 'guffaws from Drax', 'sadism from Rocket', 'etc'], ['first movie']]"

205,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Great Adventure,"My main criticism was that I don't feel like you needed to have seen the previous movie to really get/enjoy this one. You would have missed out on the bonding of the team and the backstory of Nebula and Gamora, but overall you'd be fine. Overall, though it was a great movie, it felt more like a side story in the many adventures of the Guardians of the Galaxy and less like an actual continuation of their main story. Why? Well, we did have that wonderful cameo of great actors who portrayed the original Guardians. We had our Stan Lee cameo. And, we had Peter Quill's backstory explained. Other then that, I don't yet see how any of this advanced the main plot of Thanos or of any big threat to the Galaxy. My favorite parts of the movie were Rocket and Yondu's character growth. I felt tears in my eyes when Yondu died. Such a powerful message that parentage and parents can be such distinct things. Also, Gamora and Nebula's sister bonding and reconciliation. Their scenes were so much of what it is to be a sister.

And did Stallone's agent pay for him to be inserted? Sorry to say this just felt phoned in from the opening dancing mini-Groot all the way to the bonus Teenage Grootland.

207,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"A Lot of Fun, but Falls Short of the Original","""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" is another entry in a continuing trend of disappointing superhero movies. I'm starting to feel like a scratched record. ""Doctor Strange"" was a very good movie, but disappointing in how it missed its inherent potential. ""Logan"" was a very good movie, but disappointing how it missed its inherent potential. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" is very good but...you catch my drift.Each movie takes a different path to accomplish its misfire. ""Doctor Strange"" never went as dark as it should have. ""Logan"" perhaps went too dark and failed to develop the core relationship of the film. ""Guardians Vol. 2"" is filled with a cast of mesmerizing returning characters, but this time in an inconsistent story that has a tendency to lurch around with either too little or too much buildup.The most prominent story problem is the lack of a coherent antagonist for the first half of the film. The closest we get is a Ravenger named Taserface whose name is enough to throw Rocket into fits of laughter making him seem less antagonist and more comic relief.That's not to say this film lack a good villain. On the contrary, Ronan from Guardians Vol. 1 pales in comparison (making it one of the very few aspects wherein Vol. 2 tops Vol. 1). It's only that the movie takes it's own sweet time establishing the villain, which leaves the audience wondering what are the Guardians guarding. It's cumbersome to invest in a movie with little to no stakes. Eventually, when all is revealed, the movie almost seems to lunge over the finish line like a runner trying to come from behind.Despite all this, the movie is still a solid enough piece of entertainment, largely due to the interpersonal chemistry between the heroes. They are the reason this film works. It's not even that the story is bad. More that the story spends too much time establishing itself and not nearly enough letting the audience appreciate where the story has gone.If you're a fan of the original movie, then you're pretty much guaranteed an enjoyable experience. The returning cast is just as delightfully watchable as they were before. The new cast are all welcome additions, even Sylvester Stallone whose appearance might only be foreshadowing of a spin off or sequel. Music is employed with the same effervescence as the Vol. 1 (Groot dancing to ELO's ""Mr. Blue Sky"" stands out). James Gunn's direction of action is as entertaining as ever. In general, this movie is a lot of fun. Unfortunately, just not as much fun as the original.","[['Galaxy Vol'], ['another entry', 'trend', 'disappointing superhero'], ['a scratched record'], ['Doctor', 'Strange', 'good movie', 'inherent potential'], ['Logan', 'good movie', 'inherent potential'], ['Galaxy Vol'], ['drift.Each', 'movie', 'a different path', 'misfire'], ['Doctor', 'Strange'], ['Logan', 'the core', 'relationship', 'the film'], ['Vol'], ['a cast', 'this time', 'an inconsistent story', 'a tendency', 'much buildup.The', 'prominent story', 'problem', 'the lack', 'a coherent antagonist', 'the first half', 'the film'], ['Ravenger', 'Taserface', 'name', 'Rocket', 'laughter', 'antagonist', 'comic relief.That', 'this film', 'a good villain'], ['Ronan', 'Guardians Vol'], ['comparison', 'Vol'], ['Vol'], [], ['the movie', 'own sweet time', 'the villain', 'the audience', 'guarding'], ['a movie'], ['the movie', 'the finish line', 'a runner', 'the movie', 'a solid enough piece', 'entertainment', 'the interpersonal chemistry'], ['the reason', 'this film'], ['the story'], ['the story', 'much time', 'the audience', 'appreciate', 'the story', 'a fan', 'the original movie', 'an enjoyable experience'], ['cast'], ['The new cast', 'Sylvester Stallone', 'appearance', 'a spin', 'sequel'], ['Music', 'the same effervescence', 'Vol'], ['Groot', 'ELO', 'Mr. Blue Sky'], ['James Gunn', 'direction', 'action'], ['this movie', 'a lot', 'fun'], ['much fun']]","[['Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['entry', 'trend', 'superhero movies'], ['scratched record'], ['Doctor Strange', 'good movie', 'inherent potential'], ['Logan', 'good movie', 'inherent potential'], ['Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['drift.Each movie', 'different path', 'misfire'], ['Doctor Strange'], ['Logan', 'core relationship', 'film'], ['Guardians Vol'], ['cast', 'characters', 'time', 'inconsistent story', 'tendency', 'much buildup.The', 'story problem', 'lack', 'coherent antagonist', 'first half', 'film'], ['Ravenger', 'Taserface', 'name', 'Rocket into fits', 'laughter', 'antagonist', 'comic relief.That', 'film', 'good villain'], ['Ronan from Guardians Vol'], ['pales in comparison', 'few aspects', 'Vol'], ['tops Vol'], [], ['movie', 'own sweet time', 'villain', 'audience', 'Guardians guarding'], ['movie', 'stakes'], ['movie', 'finish line', 'runner', 'movie', 'piece of entertainment', 'interpersonal chemistry', 'heroes'], ['reason', 'film'], ['story'], ['story', 'much time', 'audience appreciate', 'story', 'fan', 'original movie', 'enjoyable experience'], ['cast'], ['new cast', 'welcome additions', 'Sylvester Stallone', 'appearance', 'spin', 'sequel'], ['Music', 'same effervescence', 'Vol'], ['Groot', 'ELO', 'Mr. Blue Sky'], ['James Gunn', 'direction of action'], ['movie', 'lot of fun'], ['much fun']]"

209,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Much better than the first one,"A lot of stuff that you've seen very much before, including saving the universe yet again that bore a striking resemblance to the end of Dr. Strange. But eh, I paid $1.75.Not that Marvel or DC is listening to me, but gets very redundant that not just the Earth but the universe is saved about every six months.Very good on humor, pace, story, and characters. Dave Bautista's Dax has improved tremendously and was the best of them all. Rocket was entertaining and Zoe Saldana was serviceable. Kurt Russel was good. I'm still baffled why Vin Diesel is top billed for three words, over and over. Not like he's questioning such a big paycheck for nothing.But I don't get Chris Pratt. He's not bad but the role needs a Harrison Ford and he ain't it. Dax Sheppard is much closer, though, but still not perfect.A lot of good writing and humor. Absurd story line but actually worked. Lapses of opportunities in the direction. Missed several of those ""moments.""

212,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,This is a worthy addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe,"THEY'RE BACK WITH TEN TIMES THE VISUAL SPLENDOR, TEN TIMES THE ACTION, AND TEN TIMES THE FUN A Movie review by: Jake Werling (may contain spoilers) Statistics: Release: May 5th, 2017, Runtime: 2 h and 16 min, Genre: Sci-fi/adventure/action, Studio: Marvel studios/Walt Disney pictures, Directed by: James Gunn, Starring: Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Coper, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Kurt Russell, Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan, Pom Klmentieff, Elizabeth Debicki, Chris Sullivan, and Sean Gunn. Rated PG-13 for Sequences of sci-fi action and violence, language, and brief suggestive content. Back in the Summer of 2014, the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie surprised both audiences and critics alike, At the time, the movie was probably based-off of the least known Marvel comic book. It wasn't a comic that a random person would instantly recognize like Spider-Man or Iron Man. but the film surprisingly picked up two Oscar nominations and pleased both critics, Marvel junkies, and plain audiences alike. But this new sequel has all of the visual craziness, infectious cast antics, irreverent humor, and old seventies music that the first had and maybe even delvers a little more. This new story follows the music-loving mask wearing former thief Peter Quill a.k.a. Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), the green skinned daughter of Thanos and former assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana), the foul-mouthed mechanics genius raccoon-like creature Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper), the tattooed lunatic who cannot understand metaphors Drax (Dave Bautista), and the vocabulary-limited tree mutant who is currently regrowing Baby Groot (voice of Vin Diesel) as they continue their adventures. But a brief encounter with Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), the leader of the gold-skinned alien race the Sovereigns leads the mot start looking for the truth behind Peter's true parentage. Along the way they encounter Gamora's cyborg half-sister Nebula (Karen Gillan) who is seemingly hellbent on killing Gamora but has other motivations as well, the blue arrow wielding leader of the pirate gang the ravagers Yondu (Michael Rooker) and his Ravager accomplice Kraglin (Sean Gunn), and the mysterious but wacky living planet Ego (Kurt Russell), a god-like figure who claims to be Peter's father and his antenna-harboring empathetic naive servant Mantis (Pom Klementieff). This sequel keeps it up with both insane special effects with the spaceship warping scenes and space dogfights clearly showing that, crazy makeup (almost every character has some on especially Gamora and Nebula), beautiful cinematography with Ego's planet being a source of great beauty. Villains also appear as well, with the Ravagers new oddly-named heavily bearded leader Taserface (Chris Sullivan) and his new more elite version of the Ravagers being a source of great problem for the Guardians and the Sovereigns also want them dead too after Rocket offends them in a big way. Dark secrets surrounding Star-Lord's parents are also revealed. This film also has plenty of irreverent humor with jokes about Drax having famously huge turds and Baby Groot setting up speakers while all the other Guardians are fighting a intergalactic monster. An awesome seventies soundtrack also follows as the movie is set to the backdrop of Awesome Mixtape Vol. 2. The same old cast and all of the new additions also burst with chemistry with all the members being well-chosen. All of these features overcome the mild villain problem this movie harbors with slight timing problems being produced when the main villain comes along. Overall, this sequel will plead audiences and Marvel junkies alike, is a worthy addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and is worth checking out.","[['THEY', 'BACK WITH TEN TIMES THE VISUAL

213,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"Sequel? Oh, no!","One word - disappointment Never being fan of comics I liked the first Guardians. It was unexpected discovery - characters, humor and space entourage. So my first thought was ""Hey, when is the sequel?"". Yes, I know that sequels are often worse than the original. But there are exceptions. And this is not the case. Two words - so stretched The main problem is that this isn't the first part. At all. There are the same main characters, there are lots of jokes, some adventures... But this is different movie by its behavior. In the first part we have comedy adventure with blotches of some serious things. Characters act because, because... well, I can't remember, why they acting. They wanted money and in some point BOOM! And they are saviors of the galaxy. In Vol.2 heroes are actually heroes. They act like heroes, although have some non-heroic habits. For me the movie is too long. Somewhere near the middle, the film began to sag. At that moment you must understand main plot and, if you over six and watched several movies in your life, understand who is the main villain. Also at the middle I have such a feeling ""Boring!"". I even thought, that director want to make some kind of thriller scenes (in the middle of the film!).Three words - the sly plan But, I need to admit it, the plot is interesting and there are many references to comics about the Guardians. Even I, person that don't know anything about world of comics of the Guardians, understood it. Joy for the fans. The bad thing is - do you remember the story of the first part? Forget it. Villains from the first movie on vacation now, sorry. But we have new villain and new sly plan to conquer the galactic. Generally, interesting. Four words - where is the raccoon??? Our favorite characters come back with several others not so beloved. And if Yondu (guy with blue skin) is interesting as a character, the other one - Nebula (Gamora's sister) is looking awkward. Yondu comes to the fore and this is a good decision. You should see the film for scenes with him. But Nebula... This is stereotyped character: I hate you! Oh, you didn't hit me? I don't hate you! And I'll help you. This is all you need to know about Nebula. And new member of the Guardians team - Mantic. Cute. Can't said more. But we have problem with the main characters. Throughout the film I felt that Star-Lord and Gamora are more important. Yes, the plot is concentrated on Star-Lord's parentage. But Rocket, Drax and Groot... feels like heroes of the second plan. Yondu has more charisma and he is more interesting. If I wasn't watching first movie I can think that this is Star-Lord and his team, but not the Guardians. Even so, this is the good film. Not so good as first part.

214,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"Good, maybe even great, but doesn't live up to the first.","When going to watch Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 the main thing I was looking for was to have fun, and on that account this film sure does deliver. The characters we know and love are still just as great and a couple of new people are introduced too. However, Gamora is still the most boring character out of the Guardians, and unfortunately, Drax doesn't really do a lot except tell jokes, which are very funny admittedly. Baby Groot makes up for this and is great, if not just a little worse than the last incarnation of him we saw in the last movie. Once again the villain is not great, but he is better than Ronan in the last movie. The real flaw with this movie is that it simply isn't as good as the first one. Number 1 captured lightning in a bottle and this one attempts that and comes pretty close, but in the end, doesn't. This does not make it a bad film, however. It is still hilarious, action packed and a great deal of fun improving on some elements of the original and I recommend it to any fans of Guardians of the Galaxy.

216,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,My Favorite Marvel Movie?,I absolutely love this movie. Better than the first movie in my opinion. Ego the living planet is a great villain and the Guardians are great as always. Yondu is my favorite character in the second one.

217,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Anything other than a famously large turd,"The original Guardians of the Galaxy is still my favourite of all the Marvel films, so a sequel to it was always going to be something to look forward to but also with some trepidation in case something goes horribly wrong which spoils the first film.Thankfully the film is a delight from the very start, and I do mean the very start. After a brief prologue you get the battle with the big snarly flying space octopus thingy with big teeth which has been heavily featured in the trailers played out over the credits. However your eyes are fixed only upon baby Groot dancing to ELO's Mr Blue Sky whilst chaos reigns in the background. If you don't have a huge smile at this intro you might as well stop going to the cinema! That smile stays with you throughout the film with genuine laugh out loud moments coming thick and fast.All the main five Guardians play out their parts brilliantly, with extended roles for Nebula and especially Yondu which adds to the delight. New characters such as Mantis and Ego are really well cast and played, and it is clear that what initially look like very small parts are intended for further things either within the Guardians films or as off-shoots.You will have to have seen the first film to really get this, though it doesn't need any real knowledge of the other films in the Marvel cannon. Marvel geeks ( I hold my hands up to that) will also love all the references that abound. I'm sure that there are some that I missed on first viewing. I may have even imagined some expecting them to be there, such as a distinct Dark Star vibe to Ego's first entry on top of his spacecraft ( possibly a John Carpenter nod, but again maybe something I have over thought)Okay it doesn't have that freshness of the original but it's a sequel so what do you expect. Fabulous from start to finish.

220,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Guardians of the Sequel,"Guardians of the Galaxy delivered a fantastic modern space opera which captured the hearts of audiences and critics alike. The pressure was on for James Gunn and his team to avoid the curse of the terrible sequels. Was Gunn's aim on point or did he overshoot the target and put a bullet in this awesome ensemble?THE PLOT The long-awaited continuation of the Awesome Mix Vol 1. regroups us with The Guardians of the Galaxy, who survive by doing some good, some bad and a bit of both throughout the universes. On their journey through space they help others out of trouble and more often than not, work themselves into trouble. When they are met by Ego, a mysterious and powerful being, the future of this unlikely bunch of misfits is all but certain. What purpose does Ego have in mind for our beloved Star- Lord? What will become of the Guardians? How does an iconic 80's action movie- star have a place in this film? Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2. will provide overall satisfying answers. THE POSITIVES The tone and humor which got so many people hooked on the original, is preserved for its sequel. Thank Gunn for that! James Gunn managed to recapture that tone and sense of humor almost perfectly a second time over. All of the Guardians have their distinct personalities and fitting sense of humor but are given a lot more character development in Volume 2. The characters Gunn chose to reintroduce, are interesting due to compelling backstories and some creative, touching and funny character moments. Watching action scenes featuring characters you love and care about, adds so much drama and weight to the action and makes the movie all the more enjoyable. The action itself is creative, fun and often times hilariously over the top. With any great superhero film, there comes the need for a compelling villain. MARVEL doesn't have an amazing track record as far as villains go. Remember the villain of Thor: The Dark World, or his plan? No, me neither... Or what about the incredible emotional depth that was given to that bald guy from Ant-Man... Oh wait. With great relief I can say that the Guardians face off against a much more compelling and interesting villain in Vol 2. than in the original. His plan and motivation could be considered abstract and pretty vague. But to its credit, the movie does take its time to set up the big bad plan reveal and by that point you're on board with it. Volume 2 takes a lot of time to develop a lot of characters. All this time and effort pays off at the end with an incredible final act and an emotional ending which left me in tears.Finally, a special mention needs to be made for Baby Groot, who steals every scene he's in. He's adorable, funny, bad-ass and oh so very charming! An absolute fan favorite and a toy-seller for sure. Also, Yondu gets some genuine great development. His character arch is so touching, so unexpected and emotional. It elevated the entire film. As far as the actual Awesome Mix Vol 2. goes, I can happily say it's amazing! With a lot of upbeat classics and heartwarming ballads, this soundtrack is a must-own. THE NEGATIVES One of the reasons Guardians of the Galaxy is so beloved is because of its tight story. It is based in the same universe as The Avengers and its heroes but didn't need to tie in to the other films so firmly. Just an infinity stone and a cameo by Thanos were enough to establish the connection. What we got was a solid stand-alone film that had a compact story with colorful characters that didn't need to set up six other films. Can you name another MARVEL film that had the exact same advantage? Because of the fact that Volume 2 pays so much attention to character development for a lot more characters than just the Guardians, the story loses focus and a firm grip on the plot. Although the backstories given to our characters, are pretty cool and interesting, it's the way they are conveyed that makes the film lose some steam. There's a lot of exposition and not all of it through well written dialogue. I would've preferred some tight flashback scenes. A lot more ""Show"", a lot less ""Tell"". Then there's the unfortunate need to set up plot-points and characters for future Guardians- films. All this makes for a bit of a messy film with some pacing issues. Gunn clearly tried to balance all these character and plot-points and hasn't come unscathed out of the ordeal. It's weird he went down this route because story-wise, this film is even more disconnected from the Infinity War than the fist one. So setting up so much material for a sequel, is an odd choice because it feels so unnecessary. THE VERDICT Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2, slightly bends under the weight of its predecessor but still manages to deliver a fun Space adventure and some much appreciated character development. Even though Gunn and his gang, incorporated a lot more exposition and sequel setups, Volume 2 is still an Awesome Mix of fun, action, drama and colorful characters. With a fantastic ending, I can't wait to see the Guardians return!","[['Galaxy', 'a fantastic modern space', 'opera'], ['The pressure', 'James Gunn', 'team', 'the curse'], ['Was Gunn', 'aim', 'point',

221,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,I call it Side B,"It's not often you wanted to hear side B of a tape. Unless you were too lazy to rewind it. I'm not sure how they did it but side B aka Vol. 2 is a greatest hits album. It went double Vibranuim. The cast stays in complete character only improving by letting the audience get to know and love them. Even Drax's absurd laugh was necessary. They did not drag you through the beef between sisters, x gang affiliates or father and son. They only produced an appropriate outcome for each situation that leaves the studio wide open for Vol. 3.

222,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"Awesome Mix, Volume 2","When I first saw Guardians of the Galaxy in 2014, I had never heard of the team before and was only watching it because I was a Marvel fan. Ironically, 3 years later Guardians is about the only MCU series I even bother keeping up with any more(not that I don't like the others, I just kind of got burnt out after 15+ films all trying to tie in). I was nervous, because what made the first film so memorable to me was how much it's quality and humor surprised me, something which I was sure Vol. 2 would try and fail to recreate, as many sequels to surprise smash hits tend to do. However, director James Gunn has surprised me once again, taking the Guardians into new territory in a film filled with top notch action, impressive visuals, and gut splitting humor in a storyline that is refreshingly original.I was worried after seeing the trailers that this would ultimately be an attempt to catch lightning twice by basically repeating the first film with new jokes. But the trailers are pretty misleading(which is always a good thing with sequels) because the plot that they reveal is really only the first act of the film, including the spoiler character reveal at the end of the last trailer. This is where the viewers I think will be polarized, because after the fairly conventional first act Vol. 2 becomes a very different film than the original. I won't go into the villains, of which the film has multiple, because it's unclear who will be the main antagonist until the plot reveals it, bringing the film's multiple threads together.Although the plot was well written, what truly makes this movie work, much like the first, is the characters. In true sequel fashion, we see the core group split up for a large portion of the film, but the side characters are so well written that it is just as enjoyable to see our team interact with them as it is when they interact with each other. It also allows each character to expand their arc rather than just playing their respective parts on the team. The humor is excellent throughout, and it seems to have gotten even more adult oriented this time around, with many hilarious, not so subtle sexual innuendos making the audience laugh out loud. All in all, if you enjoyed the first film then I cannot see how the second part could be any less entertaining to you. With top notch humor, an engaging story, and beautiful special effects, Guardians 2 provides a great escape to a pop culture savvy corner of the Galaxy that we all wish to visit again and again.P.S. if you enjoyed Michael Rooker's hilarious redneck space pirate Yondu the first time around, I'll go as far as saying he's the MVP in this installment.","[['Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'the team', 'Marvel', 'fan'], ['MCU', 'series', 'kind'], ['the first film', 'quality', 'humor', 'something', 'Vol'], ['smash'], ['director', 'James Gunn', 'new territory', 'a film', 'top notch', 'action', 'gut', 'humor', 'a storyline', 'an attempt', 'the first film'], ['pretty misleading', 'a good thing', 'the plot', 'the first act', 'the film', 'the spoiler', 'character', 'reveal', 'the end', 'the last trailer'], ['conventional first act', 'Vol'], ['different film'], ['the film', 'the main antagonist', 'the plot', 'the film', 'the plot', 'this movie', 'work'], ['true sequel', 'fashion', 'the core', 'group', 'a large portion', 'the film', 'the side', 'team', 'interact'], ['each character', 'arc', 'the team'], ['The humor', 'this time', 'subtle sexual innuendos', 'the audience', 'laugh', 'loud'], ['the first film', 'the second part'], ['top notch', 'humor', 'story', 'a great escape', 'a pop culture', 'savvy', 'corner', 'Galaxy'], ['Michael Rooker', 'hilarious redneck', 'space', 'pirate', 'Yondu', 'the first time', 'MVP', 'this installment']]","[['Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'team', 'Marvel fan'], ['years', 'Guardians', 'MCU series', 'others', 'kind', 'films'], ['first film', 'quality and humor', 'something', 'sure Vol'], ['many sequels', 'smash hits'], ['director James Gunn', 'Guardians', 'new territory', 'film', 'notch action', 'impressive visuals', 'gut', 'humor', 'storyline', 'trailers', 'attempt', 'first film', 'new jokes'], ['trailers', 'pretty misleading', 'thing with sequels', 'plot', 'first act', 'film', 'spoiler character reveal', 'end', 'last trailer'], ['viewers', 'act Vol'], ['different film'], ['villains', 'film', 'main antagonist', 'plot', 'film', 'multiple threads', 'plot', 'movie work', 'characters'], ['sequel fashion', 'core group', 'large portion', 'film', 'side characters', 'team interact'], ['character', 'arc', 'respective parts', 'team'], ['humor', 'time', 'subtle sexual innuendos', 'audience laugh', 'loud'], ['first film', 'second part'], ['notch humor', 'story', 'beautiful special effects', 'great escape', 'culture savvy corner', 'Galaxy'], ['Michael Rooker', 'redneck space pirate Yondu', 'first time', 'MVP', 'installment']]"

224,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,OK...I guess.,"The first thing that went through my mind after I left the theater was:Too. Much. CGI.Don't get me wrong: I love some epic battles, but here it just felt constant to the point of nausea. Where's the suspense if our heroes survive a score of against-the-odds fights? Yes, we all know the hero(es) must win one of those in a any of these movies. But half a dozen or so? Come on. At some point nothing feels like a threat anymore. And certainly the CGI doesn't help. Yes it's pretty, but it feels pointless despite (or maybe just because of) its obvious over-prettiness. It's one 'oh golly' scene after another. When will Hollywood learn that that doesn't work?On the positive side: What we do get are some good moments from Nebula and Gamora, Yondu and Rocket - and of course Baby Groot steals the show (not a good sign when your best character is a CGI creature with only one line of dialogue). The other characters (including Pratt's lead and Russel's villain) came off as very superficial (I know that Drax is supposed to be that - but his kind of cringe/toilet humor just doesn't do it for me).Speaking of humor: I dunno. The first movie seemed to have this down better. It's like they were trying too hard this time around. The 'duct tape' scene was genuinely funny, though, I'll give them that.The music: Also very forgettable. Is this the best they could scrounge up for an 80's mix tape? I didn't recognize a single song (and yes, I grew up in that time period).So is it a good movie? No. It's passable. A textbook example of a sequel. Something that will either be forgotten if the third installment is good, or will be marked as the point when the franchise went downhill. Do I want to watch a sequel? Probably not.

225,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"Mindless entertainment, boring storyline","OK, this is not a bad movie, but it is by no means good.The vibe you get from this is that it was aimed at children with comdey moments for adults.The story deviated MASSIVELY from the comics, and while I generally don't mind so long as it's done well... this isn't.In the comic Peter Quill's dad is J'son, Emperor of the Spartoi Empir (kind of like the Shi'ar), not a celestial.

227,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Very disappointing,"I have to start by saying the first film was my favourite film of the last few years and I'm a huge fan.But let's be honest, this was a huuuge let down of a sequel after an amazing first film. The first had a good story, fleshed out characters, believable villains, genuine affection, drama, tension and a soundtrack that was original and used brilliantly.This film had a weak, bloated story. Almost every scene filled with forced, cheap gags. Unbelievable and disappointing bad guys who tried to wise crack their through and lost any menace. Acting was poor apart from Yondu and Nebula who was woefully underused.This was was like a comedy parody of the first film.

228,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Star Lords Episode 2: The Daddy issue strikes back,"Three years ago James Gunn proved to the world a number of things; 1) You can make a great superhero movie based off heroes that aren't already household names, 2) The 1980's had a lot of awesome songs that you didn't know where awesome back then, 3) you can get a good acting performance from a wrestler who isn't the Rock. And finally, 4) you can turn the funny fat guy from Parks and Recreation into a freaking sex symbol. It's fair to say Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 has quite a tough act to follow... Fortunately, Gunn follows up his space epic as best he realistically could, with a film that feels even more 80's than its predecessor.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 is a fun, escapist action movie that is very reminiscent of the action films of the 1980's. In fact, I view this film as James Gunn's attempt at making a light hearted, super cheesy and clichéd 80's action blockbuster, in an age where all blockbusters are dark and super serious. Hell Sly Stallone and Kurt Russell are in this film, how much more 80's action can you get? I commend Gunn for attempting to expand what the soundtrack of his last film achieved, and for giving the audience some good quality, escapist fun.Of course, this film looks beautiful. The visual effects, costume, makeup, production design and everyone else who helped bring this galaxy to life really outdoes themselves. I honestly found myself suspending utter disbelief, thanks in large part to the realistic detail put into everything on screen. I also praise James Gunn again for making a very stylistic film that although is far from original, still manages to somehow feel fresh.But what about the team we have all come to love I hear you cry? They are all back, yes even Vin Diesel, and they haven't changed a bit. Chris Pratt plays the very Chris Pratt like Star Lord, who is just as Chris Pratt like as ever. Zoe Saldana is still your least favourite and Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel return also to voice act Rocket and Groot, as previously confirmed, yes, Vin Diesel is credited for this. Personally, my favourite actor and Guardian in this film has to be Dave Bautista as Drax. Bautista nails the character and every line he is given like a goddamn Batista Bomb. He is absolutely hilarious in this film, and thankfully saves James Gunn's rather unfunny script with his excellent comedic delivery.Speaking of Gunn's script, lets get into some of the issues shall we? This film is filled with a lot of one liners and jokes, which is fine if they are either; A) funny and frequent or B) Unfunny and infrequent. The jokes in Vol.2 are unfortunately unfunny and far too frequent, I've heard people refer to this film as more of a comedy with action than an action film with comedy, to which personally I believe this should be the latter. Gunn really needed to hold back with the jokes in this film, I understand why they're there as I read this as an 80's action film made in 2017, but lots of these jokes feel really forced to the point where it's almost like Gunn is exclaiming ""laugh god damn you!"" The film is also very predictable, this isn't the issue for me as again it fits with the 80's aesthetic. My problem is with the different plots going on at once and how they remain, for the most part, disjointed for the majority of the films run time. It makes this film drag on a little bit longer than you would wish. Also the fact that Pratt, Saldana and Bautista don't really do anything for 80% of the film, and more or less wait around on Planet Dad for the finale to happen. This was annoying if you ask me. I almost wanted to poke them with a stick and say ""shoot something.""All in all, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 is the best possible follow up Gunn could have crafted, in my opinion. The film is visually stunning but the script could have done a bit more with its story and a little less with its attempts at humour, just cut to Drax or Groot and laughter is guaranteed. This film is far from original but finds other ways of staying fresh and fun. The Guardians trilogy looks to compete for the best MCU trilogy yet. Will Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 be as good, if not better than the first two, and surpass Captain America as the best MCU trilogy? Tune in next time as the Guardians of the Galaxy will return.","[['James Gunn', 'the world', 'a number', 'a great superhero', 'movie', 'a lot', 'a good acting', 'performance', 'a wrestler', 'Rock'], ['the funny fat guy', 'Parks', 'Recreation', 'a freaking sex', 'symbol'], ['Galaxy Vol'], ['a tough act', 'Gunn', 'space', 'epic', 'a film', 'Galaxy Vol.2', 'a fun', 'escapist action', 'movie', 'the action'], ['fact', 'this film', 'James Gunn', 'attempt', 'a light', 'super cheesy', 'action', 'blockbuster', 'an age'], ['Hell Sly Stallone', 'Kurt Russell', 'this film', 'action'], ['Gunn', 'the soundtrack', 'last film', 'the audience', 'some good quality', 'fun.Of course', 'this film'], ['costume', 'makeup', 'production', 'design', 'everyone', 'this galaxy', 'life'], ['utter disbelief', 'large part', 'the realistic detail', 'everything', 'screen'], ['James Gunn', 'stylistic film', 'the team'], ['Vin Diesel', 'a bit'], ['Chris Pratt', 'Chris Pratt', 'Star Lord', 'Chris Pratt'], ['Zoe Saldana', 'Bradley Cooper', 'Vin Diesel', 'return', 'act', 'Rocket', 'Groot', 'Vin Diesel'], ['favourite actor', 'Guardian', 'this film', 'Dave Bautista', 'Drax'], ['Bautista', 'the character', 'every line', 'a goddamn', 'Batista Bomb'], ['this film', 'James Gunn', 'unfunny script', 'excellent comedic delivery.Speaking', 'Gunn', 'script'], ['This film', 'a lot', 'funny', 'frequent', 'B', 'Unfunny', 'infrequent'], ['Vol.2', 'this film', 'a comedy', 'action', 'an action', 'film', 'comedy', 'the latter'], ['Gunn', 'this film', 'action', 'film', 'the point', 'Gunn', 'god', 'damn'], ['The film', 'the issue'], ['problem', 'part', 'the majority', 'time'], ['this film', 'drag', 'a little bit'], ['the fact', 'Pratt', 'Saldana', 'Bautista', 'anything', '%', 'the film', 'Planet Dad', 'the finale'], [], ['a stick', 'shoot something'], ['Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol.2', 'Gunn', 'opinion'], ['The film', 'the script', 'a bit', 'story', 'humour', 'Drax', 'Groot', 'laughter'], ['This film', 'fun'], ['trilogy', 'MCU', 'trilogy'], ['Galaxy Vol.3', 'surpass', 'Captain America', 'MCU', 'trilogy'], ['Tune', 'next time', 'Galaxy']]","[['years', 'James Gunn', 'world', 'number of things', 'superhero movie', 'heroes', 'names', 'lot', 'awesome songs', 'acting performance', 'wrestler', 'Rock'], ['guy from Parks', 'Recreation', 'sex symbol'], ['Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol'], ['tough act', 'Gunn', 'space epic', 'film', 'predecessor.Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol.2', 'fun', 'action movie', 'action films'], ['fact', 'film as James Gunn', 'attempt', 'light', 'super cheesy', 'action blockbuster', 'age', 'blockbusters'], ['Hell Sly Stallone', 'Kurt Russell', 'film', 'action'], ['Gunn', 'soundtrack', 'last film', 'audience', 'good quality', 'fun.Of course', 'film'], ['visual effects', 'costume', 'makeup', 'production design', 'everyone', 'galaxy', 'life'], ['utter disbelief', 'thanks', 'large part', 'realistic detail', 'everything on screen'], ['James Gunn', 'stylistic film', 'team'], ['Vin Diesel', 'bit'], ['Chris Pratt', 'Chris Pratt', 'Star Lord', 'Chris Pratt'], ['Zoe Saldana', 'Bradley Cooper', 'Vin Diesel return', 'act Rocket', 'Groot', 'Vin Diesel'], ['favourite actor and Guardian', 'film', 'Dave Bautista', 'Drax'], ['Bautista', 'character', 'line', 'goddamn Batista Bomb'], ['film', 'James Gunn', 'unfunny script', 'delivery.Speaking of Gunn', 'script', 'issues'], ['film', 'lot', 'liners and jokes', 'funny and frequent', 'B', 'Unfunny and infrequent'], ['jokes in Vol.2', 'people', 'film', 'comedy with action', 'action film', 'comedy', 'latter'], ['Gunn', 'jokes', 'film', 'action film', 'lots', 'jokes', 'point', 'like Gunn', 'god damn'], ['film', 'issue'], ['problem', 'different plots', 'part', 'majority', 'films', 'time'], ['film drag', 'little bit'], ['fact that Pratt', 'Saldana and Bautista', 'anything', '%', 'film', 'Planet Dad', 'finale'], [], ['stick', 'shoot something'], ['Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol.2', 'Gunn', 'opinion'], ['film', 'script', 'bit', 'story', 'attempts at humour', 'Drax or Groot', 'laughter'], ['film', 'other ways', 'fun'], ['Guardians trilogy', 'MCU trilogy'], ['Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol.3', 'surpass Captain America', 'MCU trilogy'], ['Tune', 'next time', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy']]"

231,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Not as Fresh as the First Time but Equally as Fun,"Picking up not too long after the events of the first film the Guardians of the Galaxy are taking the role as Heroes for Hire for jobs no one else wants to deal with. In this sequel i found it was a very self contained story and doesn't act as a extended trailer for Guardians 3 or Avengers: Infinity War which i quite enjoyed since most Marvel films seem to be following that formula recently to sell you the next film before this one is even over. Guardians 1 is a very joke heavy film so it seems obvious that they would stick with the same thing second time around which i find worked quite well even though i would say some jokes didn't feel as funny or original as the first films. Another thing i loved about this film was the soundtrack that lives up to Vol.1 pretty well, Each song is used perfectly in there scenes, personally Fleetwood Mac's 'The Chain' and Jay and the Americans 'Come a Little Bit Closer' worked brilliantly.There isn't much i didn't like about this film except that the plot probably isn't the strongest among some of the other Marvel films but as the film goes on i find this film definitely works on its character development instead of expanding the universe. Each Guardian hold their own pretty well in this film, some better than others, Star-Lord and Ego have great chemistry on screen and i really felt Kurt Russell was a great addition to the Marvel Universe. I felt Gamora didn't really have much of an input in this movie but she has her own heart felt moments with her sister Nebula, Drax has his funny moments with Mantis and Rocket begins to connect more with Yondu as they realise they have more in common than initially thought, I really enjoyed Yondu's parts in this film and thought fleshing him out more works very well this time around instead of him just being a secondary character. Baby Groot is adorable throughout the film from star to finish and brings very funny moments to the movie. Overall i do feel this film is a solid sequel to a brilliant first instalment and hold its own very high among the other Marvel films. I am looking forward to seeing them interact with the Avengers in Infinity War and after the 5 end credit scenes which all were enjoyable i am looking forward to Guardians 3","[['the first film', 'Galaxy', 'the role', 'Heroes', 'Hire', 'no one'], ['this sequel', 'i', 'story', 'a extended trailer', 'Infinity War', 'Marvel', 'formula', 'the next film', 'this one'], ['joke heavy film', 'the same thing', 'second time', 'i'], ['Another thing', 'i', 'this film', 'the soundtrack', 'Vol.1', 'Each song', 'Fleetwood Mac', ""'The Chain"", 'Jay', 'Bit Closer', 'brilliantly.There', 'much i', 'this film', 'the plot', 'Marvel', 'the film', 'i', 'this film', 'character', 'development', 'the universe'], ['Guardian', 'this film', 'Star-Lord', 'Ego', 'great chemistry', 'screen', 'i', 'Kurt Russell', 'a great addition', 'Marvel Universe'], ['Gamora', 'an input', 'this movie', 'own heart', 'sister', 'Nebula', 'Drax', 'Mantis', 'Rocket', 'Yondu', 'Yondu', 'this film', 'this time', 'a secondary character'], ['Baby Groot', 'the film', 'star', 'the movie'], ['Overall i', 'this film', 'a solid sequel', 'a brilliant', 'first instalment', 'Marvel'], ['forward', 'Infinity War', 'end', 'credit', 'enjoyable i', 'forward']]","[['events', 'first film', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'role as Heroes', 'Hire for jobs', 'one'], ['sequel i', 'story', 'trailer for Guardians', 'Avengers', 'Infinity War', 'Marvel films', 'formula', 'next film', 'one'], ['Guardians', 'joke heavy film', 'same thing', 'second time', 'i', 'jokes', 'first films'], ['thing i', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'Vol.1', 'song', 'scenes', 'Fleetwood Mac', ""'The Chain"", 'Jay', 'Americans', 'Bit Closer', 'brilliantly.There', 'much i', 'film', 'plot', 'Marvel films', 'film', 'i', 'film', 'character development', 'universe'], ['Guardian', 'film', 'others', 'Star-Lord and Ego', 'chemistry on screen', 'i', 'Kurt Russell', 'great addition', 'Marvel Universe'], ['Gamora', 'input', 'movie', 'own heart', 'moments', 'sister Nebula', 'Drax', 'moments with Mantis', 'Rocket', 'Yondu', 'Yondu', 'parts', 'film', 'works', 'time', 'secondary character'], ['Baby Groot', 'film from star', 'funny moments', 'movie'], ['Overall i', 'film', 'solid sequel', 'brilliant', 'first instalment', 'Marvel films'], ['forward', 'Avengers in Infinity War', 'end credit scenes', 'enjoyable i', 'forward']]"
232,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,A compelling and funny sequel,"James Gunn returns with the sequel to the Guardians of the Galaxy with a movie that brings back many of the things that made the original so great. Is it greater than the first though? It is hard to rank one above the other, but I still believe the first installment (in what is now going to be a trilogy) deserves the nod. Led by the continuously likable and charismatic Chris Pratt as Star-Lord, we join the Guardians on a journey across the planets and galaxies. Vol. 2 introduces many new characters such as Mantis and Peter Quill aka Star Lord's father, Ego, the latter played by Kurt Russell. The characters of Drax and Rocket were hilarious as usual, Drax especially in many scenes. We learn more of the intense relationship between the sisters Gamora and Nebula, but there were two who really stood out for me: Baby Groot and (surprisingly) Yondu. Baby Groots time on camera created many laughs, not just for his sheer cuteness, but for his interactions with the other characters. Yondu in this movie was given far more story to deal with, and it certainly paid off. It made you really care for him on an emotional level, which does sound quite unusual given he is a ravager. And last but not least, Star-Lord, and being the lead character, deserved all the attention because he was great. The movie was another great entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe and has created more anticipation for Avengers: Infinity Wars where we will see the Avengers team up with the Guardians. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 will provide more laughs, more emotion and more action for any movie viewer, led by a great director and cast.","[['James Gunn', 'the sequel', 'Galaxy', 'a movie'], [], ['the first installment', 'a trilogy', 'the nod'], ['the continuously', 'Chris Pratt', 'Star-Lord', 'a journey'], ['Vol'], ['Mantis', 'Peter Quill', 'Star Lord', 'father', 'Ego', 'Kurt Russell'], ['Drax', 'Rocket', 'Drax'], ['the intense relationship', 'Gamora', 'Nebula', 'Baby Groot', 'Yondu'], ['Baby Groots', 'time', 'camera', 'sheer', 'cuteness'], ['Yondu', 'this movie', 'story'], ['an emotional level', 'a ravager'], ['Star-Lord', 'the lead', 'character', 'the attention'], ['The movie', 'another great entry', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe', 'anticipation', 'Infinity', 'Avengers', 'team'], ['Galaxy Vol.2', 'emotion', 'action', 'any movie', 'viewer', 'a great director', 'cast']]","[['James Gunn', 'sequel', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'movie', 'things'], [], ['first installment', 'trilogy', 'nod'], ['continuously', 'Chris Pratt', 'Star-Lord', 'Guardians', 'journey', 'planets and galaxies'], ['Vol'], ['introduces', 'many new characters', 'Mantis', 'Peter Quill', 'Star Lord', 'father', 'Ego', 'Kurt Russell'], ['characters of Drax', 'Rocket', 'Drax', 'many scenes'], ['intense relationship', 'sisters Gamora', 'Nebula', 'Baby Groot', 'Yondu'], ['Baby Groots time', 'camera', 'many laughs', 'sheer cuteness', 'interactions', 'other characters'], ['Yondu', 'movie', 'story'], ['emotional level', 'ravager'], ['Star-Lord', 'lead character', 'attention'], ['movie', 'great entry', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe', 'anticipation for Avengers', 'Infinity Wars', 'Avengers team', 'Guardians'], ['Guardians', 'Galaxy Vol.2', 'laughs', 'emotion', 'action', 'movie viewer', 'great director and cast']]"

It tries to be bigger and badder but instead feels bloated and unnecessary, with a plot that involves the main characters sitting around aimlessly for a while and the only interest coming from supporting players in their own mini-adventures. The film has a dumber, more lowbrow feel than before, with jokes about body parts and functions that feel rather crass.

235,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Excellent film!,"I don't particularly like Marvel films generally – they all appear the same, with by-the-numbers, easily forgettable plots. However, Guardians 2 is different, like the first film was.My favourite things about the film are: The characterizations. Rocket (he's very well done and even more expressive than he was in Guardians 1) and Baby Groot. All the characters are pretty good, especially the two leads, and Drax comes into his own more in Guardians 2 than he did in the first film. Yondu did very well here, too. I like the mixture of fun and emotion, including sadness. The visuals.

236,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,This Intergalactic Superhero Movie was Marvelous. What a blast!,"'Guardians of the Galaxy' was once known, as one of the least recognized Marvel comic books of all time, even with 2008 reboot by writers Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning. However, that all change in 2014, when director James Gunn create a cosmic masterpiece of a film, loosely based on this offbeat source. Nobody saw it, coming. It was like, 'Star Wars' for a new generation. A peculiar small popcorn flick that somehow became a successful, because how fun, it was to watch. It really did eclipses everything around it, at the time, even strong Marvel movies like 'the Avengers"" series. It was a blockbuster hit that was mostly universally loved. So, it was no surprised to anybody, that a sequel was quickly greenlight, and put out in production. You don't need to see space to know, a shining star. Just like the original movie, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.' shines just as bright. It's equally as fun, as the first movie. Yet, unlike the first movie, this film does suffer from some long pacing issues. I found the movie to be, a bit slow at times. Mostly, toward the beginning of the film, where the story had to brand off, into multiply subplots for each character of the Guardians team. Don't get me wrong, I did like, seeing them, having something to do, while, Star-Lord AKA Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) learn more about his true parentage from Ego, the living planet (Kurt Russell) as we learn, more about them. However, I just felt, that the film could had speed it, up a bit. After all, did we really need long-drawn out scenes with Gamora (Zoe Saldana) dealing with family problems with Nebula (Karen Gillen) or Rocket (Voiced by Bradley Cooper) teaming up with Yondu (Michael Rooker) to take on, below-average, traitor, Taserface (Chris Sullivan). Couldn't these two problems, be solved, a lot quicker, than the 136 runtime. I get that, family is a big theme in this movie and serves as its unifying plot thread, but all these individual character arches needed to be better balanced. It doesn't help that the movie kinda waste time on jokes that somewhat fall flat for me. A good example is, most of the scenes with Baby Groot (Voiced by Vin Diesel). Yes, he's adorable, but do we really need to see him, dance around in a fight scene for so long. I didn't find it, as funny as I should had. If anything, it just slow the movie, down for me. Honestly, if there was one character that really makes this film, enjoyable to watch. It has to be Drax (Dave Bautista). Most of the jokes with him hit my funny bone, because how quick, they landed. It wasn't drawn out like the ones with Groot or Rocket. It was rapid and on the point. While, the movie is not as funny as the original, at least, the antagonist in this movie is a huge improvement from the last one. Without spoiling too much, he wasn't as one-note evil, as the others Marvel villains. He does seem, a little better-rounded; than the others, however, it does feel, a bit odd, that he would reveal Peter Quill's mother death, seeing how he's secretly trying to work with him. That was a bit, out of the blue. The same, can be said with Yondu suddenly becoming more of a father-figure to Peter, than the first movie. That was weird that he was willing to help Peter, seeing how he was trying to kill him in the previous movie. Still, I did like how the film, had more stakes in its climatic action, than the last film. Seeing important Marvel characters die in the battle really does add to the intensity & emotional impact of the action scenes. I love how Gunn isn't afraid to have this adventure cost the lives of some of his characters. That being said, it does kinda ruins the oncoming 'Infinity War' movies, seeing how a small group of people can kill a God. How can a normal villain like Thanos (Josh Brolin), do any better? Another thing, the battle was still a bit too massive and incomprehensible for a realistic action set-piece. Parts of it, was a bit over the top like the leap through space and time. However, the visuals were still impressive. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is as beautiful to look at as the first movie, with its bright, almost 1970s's style psychedelic aesthetic. Yet, the movie doesn't have the same amount of awesome with its soundtrack as the predecessor. Don't get me wrong, the movie does have some good songs, but it was just not as impactful. Some of the tunes, really didn't fit with the scenes, its sync with. The same can be said with its cameos. I really have no clue, why the movie would introduce the original members of the comic's 1969's incarnation of the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' by Arnold Drake and Gene Colan without establishing their history, first. It's a hard sell for a spin-off film. Nevertheless, I dig the Stan Lee cameo, toward the end. That was nice. Also, if anybody was looking forward to any ""Avengers: Infinity War' teaser in the end credit. They would quickly be disappointed. None of the mid- and post-credit scenes doesn't shows that. Overall: With all that say, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' doesn't really need to tie with any of the other MCU films. It pretty much works as its standalone sequel with everybody, old & new playing their part, well, even if some actors voices is a little bit jarring, like Michael Rooker. For the most part, it delivers on the things you love about the first movie, and improve on it. I highly recommended seeing this movie.","[['Galaxy', 'Marvel', 'all time', 'reboot', 'Dan Abnett', 'Andy Lanning'], ['all change', 'director', 'James Gunn', 'a cosmic masterpiece', 'a film', 'this

238,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,OK back to the Marvel Series.,"Ego had Children across many planets, hoping to create a child that could create life, and become God-like like Ego himself. Yondo was seconded to deliver children from each planet, but once he knew Ego killed those that could not summon the power to become a God. He kept him with his group of Ravagers and taught him the strength and skills required to be a master Ravager. Hence why Yondo always had a sof spot for the Star-Lord (Peter Quill) Chris Pratt.The Guardians struggle to keep together as a team while dealing with their personal family issues, notably Star-Lords encounter with his Father the ambitious celestial being Ego. The love all gets a bit to much.After stealing some extremely valuable Batteries from a Snooty high Priestess, the Guardians crash on a planet where they meet Ego for a 2nd time. The man who claims to be Quills father. They go with Ego to his home planet, where he iforms everyone he is a God, meaning Quill is too. Although Ego;s planet seems like Paradise to Quill, Gamora is uneasy and when she goes to investigate she discovers Egos greatest secret.Yondo ""Ego may have been your Father, but he wasn't your Daddy"".Yondo always took Peter under his wing, which is what caused a Muting.Best supporting Actor goes to Yondo's Arrow / Spear!!","[['Ego', 'Children', 'a child', 'life', 'God-like', 'Ego'], ['Yondo', 'each planet', 'Ego', 'the power', 'God'], ['group', 'Ravagers', 'the strength', 'a master', 'Ravager'], ['Hence', 'Yondo', 'a sof spot', 'Star-Lord', 'Peter Quill', 'Chris Pratt.The Guardians', 'struggle', 'a team', 'personal family', 'Star-Lords', 'encounter', 'Father', 'Ego'], ['The love', 'a bit', 'Snooty', 'Priestess', 'crash', 'a planet', 'Ego', 'a 2nd time'], ['The man', 'Quills', 'father'], ['Ego', 'home', 'planet', 'everyone', 'God', 'Quill'], ['Ego', 's planet', 'Paradise', 'Quill', 'Gamora', 'Egos', 'secret.Yondo', 'Ego', 'Father', 'Daddy', '.Yondo', 'Peter', 'wing', 'Muting.Best', 'Actor', 'Yondo', 'Arrow', 'Spear'], []]","[['Ego', 'Children', 'many planets', 'child', 'life', 'God-like like Ego'], ['Yondo', 'children', 'planet', 'Ego', 'power', 'God'], ['group of Ravagers', 'strength and skills', 'master Ravager'], ['Hence', 'Yondo', 'sof spot', 'Star-Lord', 'Peter Quill', 'Chris Pratt.The Guardians struggle', 'team', 'family issues', 'Star-Lords encounter', 'Father', 'Ego'], ['love', 'bit', 'valuable Batteries', 'Snooty', 'high Priestess', 'Guardians crash', 'planet', 'Ego', '2nd time'], ['man', 'Quills father'], ['Ego', 'home planet', 'everyone', 'God', 'Quill'], ['Ego', 's planet', 'Paradise', 'Quill', 'Gamora', 'Egos', 'secret.Yondo', 'Ego', 'Father', 'Daddy', '.Yondo', 'Peter', 'wing', 'Muting.Best', 'Actor', 'Yondo', 'Arrow / Spear'], []]"
239,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Another Awesome Ride With the Guardians!,"As good as Vol. 1? I believe so. This movie came out just as wonderful as the first. A perfect 10/10 again. From all the Marvel films, Guardians of the Galaxy takes the win and favorite. If you have not yet seen either of the two, I strongly recommend them.Following our favorite bad mouthing heroes, Starlord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket, and probably everyone's favorite baby Groot. This time though we get to learn some back story's and most importantly who Starlord's father really is. An emotional but funny space journey. Hats off to James Gunn again pulling off another incredible film. From start to finish we get to learn more about these heroes which was left out of the first volume. And with doing so, great jokes and some intense action. One of the reasons I love Guardians so much is the music/soundtrack. Beautiful music that of course comes from Starlord which gives it a much more deep element than just random thrown in music. It is who he is. And glad of the song choices they picked this time round. You almost want to jump up and start dancing. In the first volume, Starlord stuck out and believe you loved him the most. Whereas this one I praise James Gunn on Drax, Dave Bautista who plays him. This character will have you on the edge of your seat laughing. Probably the best jokes come from him. But what is also beautiful is just how kids actually enjoy him much more. Baby Groot of course takes some of the cake for his cuteness. Each character has their own little world which fits perfectly. With new faces to get to know as well. But I also have to mention Michael Rooker's character, Yondu. Again another character who stuck out in this film with more of a backstory and such a step up. An awesome character that is downright B.A. In the comics he is one of the original Guardians but for the film is a Ravager. But how Rooker plays Yondu is absolutely brilliant. I would go as far to say that he deserves an award for such a talented performance along with Bautista.The only downside I saw with this film is how it takes awhile before the story/plot come into play. You sort of wonder where it's going, but by the end of the film, it all comes together. You'll appreciate the way they do it. Otherwise I can't say anything I didn't like about it. Maybe some of the jokes weren't the best, but nowadays movies aren't funny. You will get some great laughs from this film and some great emotions from these characters. Don't miss ""Awesome Mix Vol. 2!"" Or in other words, Guardians of the Galaxy!And don't forget to stay after the credits!

240,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Guardians of the galaxy back 2 Africa,"Guardians vol. 2 by far has the best opening of all the marvel movies.

Shoot, Yondu proves to be one of the greatest marvel characters of all time here.

If you want to spend your money in the best way possible, then watch this movie.Story: 10/10When the Guardians of the Galaxy was doing a job for a species I don't know, Rocket steels important batteries from them, and then the queen wants it back, they chase them until the guardians of the galaxy crash land, and they later meet up with Peter Quill's dad, who is a god, and is evil, and he want's to control the whole galaxy by killing everyone, and everything.Characters: 10/10Peter Quill: Peter Quill is unique, and funny, he's serious and not so serious, and that's why Peter Quill is such a great character.Gamora: Gamora is the most serious in the group, she never laughs, and she always plans ahead, what I just said is not a bad thing, it actually evens out the movie a bit.Drax: Drax has to be the best character in this movie, he's hilarious, he's just so different and weird, and that's why he's so funny.Baby Groot: Groot is just adorable, he's not funny, or has unique qualities, but he's just too cute.Rocket: Rocket is the gadget guy, he uses his gadgets too fight off enemies in the funniest way possible.Yondu: Yondu sadly dies, Yondu was so unique because of his arrow, he doesn't have any interesting characteristics, but I like him.Mantis: Mantis is exactly like Drax, she's not that funny but she's so naive and curious.Ego: Ego is Peter Quill's dad, he's a god, and he wants to control the whole universe, he is a pretty cliché bad guy, and that's the only bad thing about him.Action: 10/10The action is entertaining, there is a lot of CGI, and sometimes that ruins movies, but the CGI was so good that it didn't take away the entertainment, they also included comedy in the action, which makes the movie even more entertaining.Guardians of the Galaxy was great, and i'm not surprised. Marvel is doing a great job, Guardians of the Galaxy is the best movie to watch if you feel sad, happy, or angry. I could just watch this movie over and over.","[['This movie', 'the action', 'superb', 'the comedy'], ['money', 'way', 'this movie.Story', 'Galaxy', 'a job', 'Rocket', 'the queen', 'the galaxy', 'crash', 'land', 'Peter Quill', 'dad', 'a god', 'the whole galaxy', 'everyone', 'Quill', 'Peter Quill', 'Peter Quill', 'a great character.Gamora', 'Gamora', 'the group', 'a bad thing', 'the movie', 'a bit.Drax', 'Drax', 'character', 'this movie', 'Groot', 'Groot', 'Rocket', 'the gadget', 'guy', 'way', 'possible.Yondu', 'Yondu', 'arrow', 'him.Mantis', 'Mantis', 'Drax', 'curious.Ego', 'Ego', 'Peter Quill', 'dad', 'a god', 'the whole universe', 'a pretty cliché', 'bad guy', 'bad thing', 'him.Action', 'action', 'a lot', 'CGI', 'CGI', 'the entertainment', 'comedy', 'the action', 'the movie', 'Galaxy'], ['Marvel', 'a great job', 'Galaxy', 'movie'], ['this movie']]","[['movie', 'characters', 'action', 'superb', 'comedy'], ['money', 'way', 'movie.Story', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'job', 'species', 'Rocket', 'important batteries', 'queen', 'guardians', 'galaxy crash land', 'Peter Quill', 'dad', 'god', 'whole galaxy', 'everyone', 'everything.Characters', 'Quill', 'Peter Quill', 'Peter Quill', 'great character.Gamora', 'Gamora', 'group', 'bad thing', 'movie', 'bit.Drax', 'Drax', 'character', 'movie', 'funny.Baby Groot', 'Groot', 'unique qualities', 'Rocket', 'gadget guy', 'gadgets', 'enemies', 'way possible.Yondu', 'sadly dies', 'Yondu', 'arrow', 'interesting characteristics', 'him.Mantis', 'Mantis', 'like Drax', 'curious.Ego', 'Ego', 'Peter Quill', 'dad', 'god', 'whole universe', 'pretty cliché', 'bad guy', 'thing about him.Action', 'action', 'lot of CGI', 'movies', 'CGI', 'entertainment', 'comedy', 'action', 'movie', 'entertaining.Guardians', 'Galaxy'], ['Marvel', 'great job', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'movie'], ['movie']]"
245,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Way better than a superhero sequel ought to be,"I didn't love the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie when I first watched it. I thought it had some fun moments and characters that were generally likable but overall lacked anything that gave it that extra ""mmph"" to make it a good movie. It was enjoyable but not one worth revisiting. Volume 2 however I think is so good that it retroactively makes the first one better as well.Each character is written with such consistency that for each scene and plot element you understand why they're behaving the way they do. At the same time we see each of them grow and develop as actual characters with emotional depth and traits or flaws just beneath their surface. By the end of the movie I felt like I knew and liked everyone in the movie, even the minor villains from the first one felt fully fleshed out.The soundtrack and special effects work together to create an energetic, goofy environment that feels like an 80s comic book series brought to life in the 2010s in the best way possible. Some of the scenes use effects that make it feel almost cartoonish yet with an air of self-awareness so it doesn't come across as cheap or amateurish. Every silly looking scene or shot feels like it was made intentionally with love by James Gunn and the rest of the crew.Despite the light hearted nature of a lot of the movie, Gunn and the others managed to strike a balance with that and a rather effective theme of the effects of parental abuse on their children. We see Peter Quill come to grips with his tumultuous relationship with his surrogate father, and his budding relationship with his biological father which raises a series of new issues to address. We see how Gamora and Nebula both try and process the abuse they suffered under Thanos and how they view their own relationship with each other as adopted siblings. Each scene that approaches this topic is handled surprisingly well and allows the actors and actresses to carry the moment without feeling hollow or superficial.For a summer action flick by Marvel Studios which normally is little more than a fun, popcorn flick Guardians Volume 2 packs a lot of emotional weight with it and somehow made me laugh and cry without feeling like emotional whiplash. The movie isn't perfect but for me it's another talking point about how superhero movies shouldn't be automatically relegated to simplistic fun. Definitely try and check this one out if for some reason you haven't done it already.","[['Galaxy', 'movie'], ['some fun', 'anything', 'mmph', 'a good movie'], ['worth', 'revisiting'], ['Volume', 'better', 'well.Each', 'character', 'such consistency', 'each scene', 'plot', 'element', 'the way'], ['the same time', 'emotional depth', 'surface'], ['the end', 'the movie', 'everyone', 'the movie', 'felt', 'out.The soundtrack', 'goofy environment', 'comic book', 'series', 'life', 'way'], ['an air', 'self-awareness', 'cheap', 'amateurish'], ['scene', 'love', 'James Gunn', 'the rest', 'the crew.Despite', 'the light', 'nature', 'a lot', 'the movie', 'Gunn', 'a balance', 'effective theme', 'parental abuse'], ['Peter Quill', 'tumultuous relationship', 'surrogate', 'father', 'budding', 'relationship', 'biological', 'father', 'a series'], ['Gamora', 'Nebula', 'both try', 'the abuse', 'Thanos', 'own relationship'], ['Each scene', 'this topic', 'the moment', 'hollow', 'a summer', 'action', 'flick', 'Marvel Studios', 'a fun', 'popcorn flick', 'Guardians', 'Volume', 'a lot', 'emotional weight', 'cry', 'emotional whiplash'], ['The movie', 'point', 'simplistic fun'], ['try', 'some reason']]","[['first Guardians', 'Galaxy movie'], ['fun moments', 'characters', 'anything', 'mmph', 'good movie'], ['worth revisiting'], ['Volume', 'better as well.Each character', 'such consistency', 'scene', 'plot element', 'way'], ['same time', 'actual characters', 'emotional depth and traits', 'flaws', 'surface'], ['end', 'movie', 'everyone', 'movie', 'minor villains', 'felt', 'out.The soundtrack', 'special effects', 'goofy environment', 'book series', 'life', 'way'], ['scenes', 'effects', 'air of self-awareness', 'cheap or amateurish'], ['scene', 'shot feels', 'love by James Gunn', 'rest', 'crew.Despite', 'light', 'nature', 'lot', 'movie', 'Gunn', 'others', 'balance', 'effective theme', 'effects', 'parental abuse', 'children'], ['Peter Quill', 'grips', 'tumultuous relationship', 'surrogate father', 'budding relationship', 'biological father', 'series', 'new issues'], ['Gamora and Nebula', 'try', 'abuse', 'Thanos', 'own relationship', 'adopted siblings'], ['scene', 'topic', 'actors and actresses', 'moment', 'hollow', 'summer action flick', 'Marvel Studios', 'fun', 'flick Guardians Volume', 'lot', 'emotional weight', 'cry', 'emotional whiplash'], ['movie', 'point', 'superhero movies', 'simplistic fun'], ['try', 'reason']]"
246,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,The Terminator 2 of the Guardians Franchise,"I loved the first Guardians of the Galaxy. It was unexpected, hilarious, full of loveable characters, and somehow outdid the other MCU films for its wit and heart. Needless to say, my expectations were high for the sequel. After having watched this movie several times, I can say with full confidence that they were met and obliterated.GotG2 is every bit as colorful, humorous, action-packed, and endearing as the first one. The characters introduced in the first film are brought back with expanded character arcs and deeper connections. The 70's music keeps the retro vibe as well but doesn't detract from the experience like so many other movies that go overboard on popular song use. Some characters that seemed to be pretty one-dimensional in the predecessor are deepened also in this movie. In short, this movie does everything and more.The one who steals the show above all others is Drax. Every character in this movie is likeable and relatable, but Drax's humor and comedic timing are unparalleled. Nebula and Yondu also get more time to shine but aren't retconned, just explained with more depth. Mantis, making her first appearance in this movie, is a fine addition to the team and plays well off Drax's personality.Flaws? Not many, but I would say there are a couple of jokes done with an alien race of gold people that seem to come off as forced or uncomfortable. It doesn't happen often, but there are a few moments with Ayesha in particular that I could do without.Summary: This could very well be my favorite MCU movie. It combines all the great things of the Marvel movies without falling for the mistakes and cliches of most others. It is fantastic. Without a doubt.

As a superhero movie,action movie - it was just crap.Nothing happens for more than one hour and when it does it's just CGI. Characters do not show any superpowers, they are just for making jokes, there are no real fights or good action sequences. Not to mention the story is terrible. I really don't understand why everyone was so impressed by this movie.

248,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Great sequel,"Sequels are not always successful especially if the first film was successful. Often they pale in comparison however that is not true for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 that more than holds its own. The team are back and in excellent form for another space adventure. Baby Groot makes a great and humorous addition to the Guardians. The film also introduces a number of new villains and brings back some memorable old ones. It has a great story that in this genre and universe makes great sense and flows very well. So it's easy to sit back and enjoy the ride. Just like the first film the humor is effortless and the great chemistry between the cast really shows and enhances its quality. The doses of humor are very well placed and occur at the right moments. Volume 2 also had a few big moments that the film built up and it certainly drives it home.

1,Spider-Man: No Way Home,"Great concept, mediocre execution","A tough one to rate. It certainly has entertainment value, but it's frustrating that it could have been so much better. On the one hand, the concept of bringing villains and other Spidermen in from alternate universes is fantastic, and it was great to see some of these characters again. There is so much star power in the cast here, and the special effects are wonderful.On the other hand, there is quite a bit of bloat as well. I'm all for character development and non-action scenes in action movies, but too often these moments were poorly written and bogged the film down. I have to say, I didn't care for how naïve Tom Holland's version of Spider-Man was either, and I could never buy in to the concept that he would try to ""fix"" the villains before sending them back to their own universes. This seemed asinine to me, and how that would stop them from dying where they came from was a mystery too. There are several other plot elements that are either weakly crafted (Dr. Strange getting trapped by some quick Spidey-math) or boring (Peter Parker and his friends and their college admission drama, good grief). Give me more of the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), less of Ned Leeds, the goofy sidekick.","[['rate'], ['entertainment', 'value'], ['hand', 'the concept', 'alternate'], ['much star', 'power', 'the cast', 'the other hand', 'a bit', 'bloat'], ['character', 'development', 'non-action', 'action', 'the film'], ['Tom Holland', 'version', 'Spider-Man', 'the concept'], ['asinine', 'a mystery'], ['several other plot', 'Dr'], ['Spidey-math', 'Peter Parker', 'college', 'admission', 'drama', 'good grief'], ['Green Goblin', 'Willem Dafoe', 'Ned Leeds', 'the goofy', 'sidekick']]","[['rate'], ['entertainment value'], ['hand', 'concept', 'villains', 'Spidermen in from alternate universes', 'characters'], ['star power', 'cast', 'special effects', 'other hand', 'bit of bloat'], ['character development', 'non-action scenes', 'action movies', 'moments', 'film'], ['Tom Holland', 'version of Spider-Man', 'concept', 'villains', 'own universes'], ['asinine', 'mystery'], ['plot elements', 'Dr'], ['quick Spidey-math', 'Peter Parker', 'friends', 'college admission drama', 'good grief'], ['Green Goblin', 'Willem Dafoe', 'Ned Leeds', 'goofy sidekick']]"
2,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Phenomenal conclusion,"Spider-Man: No Way Home is a phenomenal conclusion to the trilogy and Holland's best outing as Spidey yet. Starts off fun, safe and familiar and then becomes extremely emotional, satisfying and full of great callbacks. A love letter to all things Spider-Man.Tom Holland gives an incredible lead performance once again, reliably charming and likeable but with a lot more emotional heft this time around. Zendaya and Jacob Batalon both have perfect chemistry with Holland and are also incredible in their own ways.Benedict Cumberbatch reaffirms why he's such a good Doctor Strange with his excellent dry wit and gravitas. All the returning villains give strong performances but Willem Dafoe is definitely the standout performance with an unsettling and terrifying presence.Jon Watts' direction is superb, the action sequences are thrillingly acrobatic once again but refreshingly impactful this time around. There's a few homages to the styles of the previous iterations and some gorgeous imagery.It's also perfectly paced with none of its roughly 2hr 30 minute runtime feeling dull or overly long due to a strong momentum established early on. The CG is extremely impressive with only a few weak spots.The music by Michael Giacchino is fantastic, a nice balance of themes from the previous iterations and use of Holland's iconic motifs which are slightly altered in ways that work as well as a few new additions that are beautifully epic.","[['Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'a phenomenal conclusion', 'the trilogy', 'Holland', 'outing', 'Spidey'], ['fun'], ['A love', 'letter', 'Spider-Man.Tom Holland', 'an incredible lead', 'performance', 'a lot', 'emotional heft', 'this time'], ['Zendaya', 'Jacob Batalon', 'perfect chemistry', 'Holland', 'own ways.Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'Doctor Strange', 'excellent dry wit'], ['Willem Dafoe', 'the standout', 'performance', 'an unsettling', 'Watts', 'direction', 'the action', 'this time'], ['some gorgeous imagery.It', 'none', 'minute', 'runtime', 'dull', 'a strong momentum'], ['CG', 'a few weak spots.The', 'music', 'Michael Giacchino', 'a nice balance', 'use', 'Holland']]","[['Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'phenomenal conclusion', 'trilogy and Holland', 'outing as Spidey'], ['Starts', 'fun', 'great callbacks'], ['love letter', 'things Spider-Man.Tom Holland', 'lead performance', 'lot', 'emotional heft', 'time'], ['Zendaya', 'Jacob Batalon', 'chemistry with Holland', 'ways.Benedict Cumberbatch', 'Doctor Strange', 'excellent dry wit and gravitas'], ['villains', 'strong performances', 'Willem Dafoe', 'standout performance', 'unsettling', 'presence.Jon Watts', 'direction', 'action sequences', 'time'], ['few homages', 'styles', 'previous iterations', 'gorgeous imagery.It', 'none', 'minute runtime', 'dull', 'strong momentum'], ['CG', 'spots.The music', 'Michael Giacchino', 'balance of themes', 'previous iterations', 'use of Holland', 'iconic motifs', 'ways', 'few new additions']]"
3,Spider-Man: No Way Home,"I consider myself to be a big fan of Marvel and definitely of Spider-Man, but something wasn't right about this film","Awful movie. The plot sucked and had awful pacing humour, and dialogue were subpar(like the octopus joke). And they couldn't think of anything better so they brought back some old characters which still didn't save this poorly written film. One bad dialogue scene was when the 3 Spider-Men where making jokes about Tobey's organic webs which was just awkward and humorless. And to add to that, Tobey saying that ""my back"" joke and Norman Osborn repeating ""I'm something of a scientist myself"". Just why?! The film could never decide whether it's a comedy or a dark action movie.This movie certifies that Tom Holland is the worst Spider-Man. With great power comes great responsibility and MCU Spider-Man lacks that. He's had 6 movies and still acts like an inexperienced, immature, not independent, not smart and acts like a rookie. And the whole plot started because he couldn't think of an alternative to get him and his friends to college so he got Doctor Strange to go and make a spell so that everyone will forget that Peter is Spider-Man(also doing it without his friends consent). And of course with Peter being the doofus he is, he messes up the spell which causes the multiverse to collide. There's a reason why his messes are always cleaned up by someone better than him. One of Spider-Man's best traits is his quick thinking and it was so inevitable that after messing up the spell, he decides to go and talk to the headteacher of the college for a placement(same scene where Doctor Octopus appears). You'd think he would have learnt his lesson about trusting villains in Far From Home but no; he does it again which caused Aunt May's death. It could have been avoided if he had just sent them home, but no they needed to be ""cured""(which is odd because The Lizard was cured in the Amazing Spider-Man). It just made him look sappy and too Disney like, thinking he can change their fate. It's also not smart to invite dangerous villains into your house with a non superhero family member there. How could he trust them that quickly? When you see it, you find it hard to feel bad for Peter because you're like ""yeah this guy sucks"" The emotional scenes in this movie were pretty awful, especially how long and stretched May's death was and they still tried to exchange jokes and had her standing up right before dying(also re wording Uncle Ben's infamous line which sounded wrong). Family member deaths are always before the character becomes a hero so doing it after feels cheap. It wasn't even basic superhero bad luck, just Spider-Man not thinking straight.Marvel really need new writers(especially in the comedic department), because they've released 4 bad movies this year and a TV show that messed up a timeline just like No Way Home did. And they've also ruined Spider-Man's character by not properly developing him and just throwing him into the Avengers drama. They are cash grabbers and only adding him because he is popular and it will get the movie ticket sales up. No Way Home is one of the few movies that make me wish the villains had won, and the reason is that the plot armour on Spider-Man was too strong. Like when geometry was somehow the answer to get out of the mirror dimension. Green Goblin was right about his morality getting the better of him.Overall this movie was just an overhyped, over budgeted nostalgia bait and Spider-Man is the real antagonist of this film. Always puts people in danger for no reason.","[['Awful movie'], ['The plot', 'humour', 'dialogue', 'the octopus', 'joke'], ['anything', 'film'], ['bad dialogue', 'scene', 'Tobey', 'organic webs', 'humorless'], ['Tobey', 'back', 'joke', 'Norman Osborn', 'something', 'a scientist'], [], ['The film', 'a comedy', 'a dark action', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'Tom Holland', 'Spider-Man'], ['great power', 'great responsibility', 'MCU Spider-Man'], ['immature', 'a rookie'], ['the whole plot', 'an alternative', 'college', 'Doctor Strange', 'a spell', 'everyone', 'Peter', 'Spider-Man', 'consent'], ['course', 'Peter', 'the doofus', 'the spell', 'the multiverse'], ['a reason', 'someone'], ['Spider-Man', 'quick thinking', 'the spell', 'the headteacher', 'the college', 'a placement', 'same scene', 'Doctor Octopus'], ['lesson', 'Far From Home', 'Aunt May', 'death'], ['home', 'Lizard', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man'], ['Disney', 'fate'], ['house', 'a non', 'superhero family', 'member'], [], ['Peter', 'this guy', 'this movie', 'May', 'death', 'Uncle Ben', 'infamous line'], ['member', 'the character', 'a hero'], ['basic superhero', 'bad luck', 'Spider-Man', 'straight.Marvel', 'the comedic department', 'this year', 'a TV', 'show', 'a timeline', 'Way Home'], ['Spider-Man', 'character', 'Avengers', 'drama'], ['cash', 'the movie', 'ticket'], ['Way Home', 'the reason', 'the plot', 'armour', 'Spider-Man'], ['geometry', 'the answer', 'the mirror', 'dimension'], ['Goblin', 'morality', 'him.Overall', 'this movie', 'nostalgia bait', 'Spider-Man', 'the real antagonist', 'this film'], ['danger', 'no reason']]","[['Awful movie'], ['plot', 'humour', 'dialogue', 'octopus joke'], ['anything', 'old characters', 'film'], ['dialogue scene', 'jokes about Tobey', 'organic webs', 'humorless'], ['Tobey', 'back', 'joke', 'Norman Osborn', 'something', 'scientist'], [], ['film', 'comedy', 'action movie.This movie certifies', 'Tom Holland', 'Spider-Man'], ['great power', 'great responsibility', 'MCU Spider-Man'], ['movies', 'immature', 'acts', 'rookie'], ['whole plot', 'alternative', 'friends', 'college', 'Doctor Strange', 'spell', 'everyone', 'Peter', 'Spider-Man', 'friends consent'], ['course with Peter', 'doofus', 'spell', 'multiverse'], ['reason', 'messes', 'someone'], ['Spider-Man', 'traits', 'quick thinking', 'spell', 'headteacher', 'college', 'placement', 'same scene', 'Doctor Octopus'], ['lesson', 'villains in Far From Home', 'Aunt May', 'death'], ['home', 'Lizard', 'Amazing Spider-Man'], ['Disney', 'fate'], ['dangerous villains', 'house', 'non', 'family member'], [], ['Peter', 'guy', 'emotional scenes', 'movie', 'May', 'death', 'jokes', 'Uncle Ben', 'infamous line'], ['member deaths', 'character', 'hero', 'feels'], ['basic superhero', 'bad luck', 'Spider-Man', 'straight.Marvel', 'new writers', 'comedic department', 'bad movies', 'year', 'TV show', 'timeline', 'Way Home'], ['Spider-Man', 'character', 'Avengers drama'], ['cash grabbers', 'movie ticket sales'], ['Way Home', 'few movies', 'villains', 'reason', 'plot armour', 'Spider-Man'], ['geometry', 'answer', 'mirror dimension'], ['Green Goblin', 'morality', 'him.Overall', 'movie', 'nostalgia bait and Spider-Man', 'real antagonist', 'film'], ['Always', 'people in danger', 'reason']]"
4,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Somehow better than Endgame,"It's hard to discuss this movie and not get into the spoilers because the biggest moments of this movie necessitate ruining several of the big reveals. I loved that not everything was in the trailer and I successfully avoided reading too much about the film, which helped my enjoyment. This was the first movie I've seen in a theater since Halloween Kills, so the risk of COVID-19 and all its variants didn't keep me away* from the biggest movie of the year.This movie arrives as so many older directors gatekeep what constitutes a movie. So let me break down my opinion: movies can be anything you want them to be. There is equal room for a high end Oscar contender as there is for the junk low end world that I live in, the places where Godfrey Ho, Jess Franco and Bruno Mattei make their home.What else are comic book movies other than classical myths made with computers and no small amount of sound and fury? So yeah, this is the 27th Marvel Cinematic Universe movie and you know, you don't have to watch these movies. Hollywood -- the world -- is still making something for everyone. But for crowd-pleasing moments, the two biggest I've heard in years are when Captain America lifted Mjolnir and when one of the characters arrived in this film, a literally explosion of happiness and joy from an audience that has weathered so much in the last two years.And isn't that why movies exist? To make us feel something?No movie that I have seen in a theater in nearly a decade has elicited that emotional outburst and you know, it brought true joy to my heart. So I didn't feel silly expressing my emotions, whether they were happy when a certain legal professional made his presence known or the sadness of Dr. Strange's final words to Peter Parker.Spider-Man has always lived by the lesson that with great power comes great responsibility. He's a character informed -- in every incarnation -- by a great loss that he was at fault for and a lifetime of making up for that mistake.Yet Spider-Man: No Way Home presents us with something new. Great power with responsibility also means being better than your enemies and at times, working to make them better people and not just punching them into oblivion. The fact that antagonists can be worth saving spoke to me, someone usually given to mad revenge schemes and years of grudges. Even when doing the right thing ends up hurting you, you still can do the right thing.These are big concepts for a comic book spectacle. And this movie does what all great films should. It's stuck in my mind since I saw it and I wanted some time away from it before I wrote this. Spider-Man is the story of a bully grown up and moving past the way he was treated, often finding those bullies -- Flash Thompson, Eddie Brock -- become if not friends, certainly no longer enemies.This also gets into the Marvel idea of a multiverse, a connected web of other realities where small differences -- Disney+ set this up with What If...? And this idea will form the heart of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness -- but the main part of this story remains refreshingly human in the midst of big ideas, strange science and concepts like how magic works.Look -- I don't have to sell you on these movies. They make so much money that they're critic proof. But I do want you to consider that even if you hate superhero movies, even if you think there are too many of them, to consider your favorite film series. What if you had more than three of the original Star Wars films and they all were progressively better? What if the last Jason, Freddy or Hellraiser movie was so much better than the original? What if James Bond got more human, more relevant and more real as the world around him became even stranger?That's what's happening here. And it's amazing.*I'm triple vaxxed, beyond fastidious about mask wearing and personal space, and rarely if ever leave my movie basement. This isn't a political statement.

5,Spider-Man: No Way Home,"A franchise in decline, and this meta nonsense doesn't help","I was already concerned about Spider-Man: No Way Home when I walked into the theater (one could say I was expecting to be disappointed.) I kind of hate the idea of delving too deep into a multiverse, because I think it muddles things too much, and defies the internal logic of most stories. Sure enough that was something I felt while watching this film. This movie cannot hold up to even the tiniest bit of analysis, because it creates plot holes that you can drive a freight train through. It's kind of sad because there were some moments in the movie that I genuinely loved, but all I can think about days later are the myriad of questions that I'm left with because this movie created so many situations that make no sense.My other big problem with Spider-Man: No Way Home is not really a fault of the movie, but more of the society we live in today. Living in an internet-focused culture, we are bombarded by ads and news stories that relate to the things that interest us. SInce I've shown my love for all things MCU in the past, of course I see plenty of things crossing my radar about the upcoming films. I was able to avoid watching any trailers for this movie, which I thought would help, but by merely catching headlines of casting rumors I could foresee every surprise they built into it. Of course any logical mind could put two and two together once the guest appearances start, so I suppose this isn't a movie that is going to blow away audiences with its surprises.As I said, though, my disappointment is quite frustrating because I also found many aspects of No Way Home so satisfying. They wrapped up some story elements nicely, and this might have contained some of the best acting in any Marvel movie. In particular, I found Zendaya so surprisingly strong, I was almost able to ignore her lack of character motivation in some key moments. She wasn't the only person in the film that behaved stupidly, in fact the central premise of the film is built on a horrible idea from Aunt May that seems altruistic, but lacks any 4th-dimensional thinking which I would expect from a genius like Peter Parker. But smart people being dumb is the catalyst of the entire story, as even Dr. Strange doesn't seem to think anything through, past Peter's initial request.No Way Home is easily the most meta Spider-Man movie ever made, which is kind of shocking to say in a post ""Into the Spider-verse"" world. It's catering to the most die-hard fans in the world, but it's more of a nod to the fans of the Spider-Man movies. I was always a huge fan of the multitude of Spider-Man comic books when I was a collector, but I've typically struggled with his portrayal in films. So, giving all these nods to things that came before Tom Holland took over the role on the big screen, falls a bit flat for me. One of the things I loved about this iteration of the character is that it avoided the cliches and saved us so much of the traditional Spider-Man origin story, but this movie back-pedaled and became a copy of a copy of a copy.This return to cliche also sucked some of the emotion out of key moments as any fan of the character should know the same old tropes by now. I almost got emotional at the end because of the great acting performances, but the big emotional moment earlier in the film did nothing for me as all I could think was ""really, we're going there?"" There are some good laughs in the film, although I wonder how well it will hold up on rewatch. And I will rewatch this film, as I do with all MCU movies, but I think at this point Spider-Man: No Way Home sits as my least favorite in the franchise. In fact, I'm at a point right now where I'm questioning if I will keep being a diehard fan of everything the MCU churns out. This film wasn't what I'd call a complete failure, but I'm concerned the MCU is getting closer to one of those. Perhaps EndGame should have been exactly what the title implies.","[['Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'the theater'], ['kind', 'hate', 'the idea', 'a multiverse', 'the internal logic'], ['something', 'this film'], ['This movie', 'bit', 'analysis', 'plot', 'a freight', 'train'], ['kind', 'sad', 'the movie', 'the myriad', 'this movie', 'no sense.My', 'other big problem', 'Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'a fault', 'the movie', 'the society', 'today'], ['an internet-focused culture', 'news', 'interest'], ['SInce', 'love', 'MCU', 'course', 'radar'], ['this movie', 'every surprise'], ['course', 'any logical mind', 'the guest', 'a movie', 'surprises.As', 'disappointment', 'Way Home'], ['some story', 'acting', 'Marvel', 'movie'], ['Zendaya', 'lack', 'character', 'motivation'], ['the only person', 'the film', 'fact', 'the central premise', 'the film', 'a horrible idea', 'Aunt May', 'any 4th-dimensional thinking', 'a genius', 'Peter Parker'], ['the catalyst', 'the entire story', 'Dr'], ['Strange', 'anything', 'Peter', 'Way Home', 'meta Spider-Man movie', 'kind', 'a post', 'Spider-verse', 'world'], ['the world', 'a nod'], ['a huge fan', 'the multitude', 'Spider-Man', 'a collector', 'portrayal'], ['Tom Holland', 'the role', 'the big screen', 'a bit'], ['this iteration', 'the character', 'the traditional Spider-Man origin', 'story', 'this movie', 'a copy', 'a copy', 'a copy.This return', 'the emotion', 'any fan', 'the character'], ['the end', 'the big emotional moment', 'the film', 'nothing'], ['the film', 'rewatch'], ['this film', 'MCU', 'this point', 'Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'the franchise'], ['fact', 'a point', 'a diehard', 'fan', 'everything', 'MCU'], ['This film', 'a complete failure', 'MCU'], ['EndGame', 'the title']]","[['Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'theater'], ['kind of hate', 'idea', 'multiverse', 'things', 'internal logic', 'stories'], ['something', 'film'], ['movie', 'bit of analysis', 'plot holes', 'freight train'], ['kind of sad', 'moments', 'movie', 'days', 'myriad of questions', 'movie', 'many situations', 'sense.My', 'problem with Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'fault', 'movie', 'society', 'today'], ['internet-focused culture', 'ads', 'news stories', 'things', 'interest'], ['SInce', 'love', 'things MCU', 'course', 'things', 'radar', 'upcoming films'], ['trailers', 'movie', 'headlines', 'rumors', 'surprise'], ['course', 'logical mind', 'guest appearances', 'movie', 'audiences', 'surprises.As', 'disappointment', 'many aspects', 'Way Home'], ['story elements', 'acting', 'Marvel movie'], ['Zendaya', 'lack of character motivation', 'key moments'], ['only person', 'film', 'fact', 'central premise', 'film', 'idea from Aunt May', '4th-dimensional thinking', 'genius like Peter Parker'], ['smart people', 'catalyst', 'entire story', 'Dr'], ['Strange', 'anything', 'past Peter', 'Way Home', 'meta Spider-Man movie', 'kind', 'post', 'Spider-verse', 'world'], ['die-hard fans', 'world', 'nod', 'fans', 'Spider-Man movies'], ['huge fan', 'multitude of Spider-Man', 'comic books', 'collector', 'portrayal in films'], ['nods', 'things', 'Tom Holland', 'role', 'big screen', 'bit'], ['things', 'iteration', 'character', 'cliches', 'origin story', 'movie', 'copy', 'copy', 'copy.This return', 'emotion', 'key moments', 'fan', 'character', 'same old tropes'], ['end', 'great acting performances', 'big emotional moment', 'film', 'nothing'], ['good laughs', 'film', 'rewatch'], ['film', 'MCU movies', 'point Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'franchise'], ['fact', 'point', 'diehard fan', 'everything', 'MCU'], ['film', 'complete failure', 'MCU'], ['EndGame', 'title implies']]"
6,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Nonsense And Nostalgia,"Review By Kamal KI don't think this film was written well. It had already established Spider-man characters with no involvement with Stark, but still failed at making Tom's Peter any better than he was when under Tony Stark's mentorship. This movie was not good. No amount of nostalgia saved it for me. It had pacing issues, for example the movie skimmed past Peter's whole identity exposed moment and chucked Daredevil in for a meaningless cameo as nobody seemed to truly care that as a blind man, he was able to catch a brick chucked through the window. He was literally just there for fanservice, and not a well written one. The rest of the movie is pointless as by the end, they just reverse everything by sending the spider-men and villains back to their world, after of course, seemingly retconning the plots of the previous spider-man movies by curing the villains, who were taken before they met their demise. Therefore their fights with spider-man end on a lame note as they all just become ordinary men towards the end of the original battles and so the Peter Parkers wouldn't experience the key character development and progression of their stories from this.And in usual MCU fashion, the film is riddled with jokes that sometimes hit, but mostly fall flat. Awful humour, which is constantly blurted out after (or during) serious moments because the writers simply couldn't leave us without jokes for two whole minutes. Constant tonal shifts because of the ""jokes"", And the Peters just felt like they needed to be there for Tom's Peter? Bad writing at its finest.Yes, this whole movie could've been avoided if Peter just listened to Doctor Strange, a man who actually knows magic and the consequences of messing spells up, but nope, he has to be stupid when he is supposed to be smart. Strange was literally the best character in the entire film, just for being the only one with a working braincell.Overall, I found this movie quite bad. Nothing about it made me want to rewatch it and I have been feeling this with MCU movies recently like Black Widow and Shang chi, I will continue to watch Spider-man movies just because of my love for the character, but I will most likely continue to think the MCU's portrayal of the character is the worst even though Tom Holland's acting is great.","[['Review', 'Kamal KI', 'this film'], ['no involvement', 'Stark', 'Tom', 'Peter', 'Tony Stark', 'mentorship'], ['This movie'], ['No amount', 'nostalgia'], ['example', 'the movie', 'Peter', 'whole identity', 'moment', 'Daredevil', 'a meaningless', 'cameo', 'nobody', 'care', 'a blind', 'man', 'a brick', 'the window'], ['fanservice'], ['The rest', 'the movie', 'the end', 'everything', 'world', 'course', 'demise'], ['spider-man end', 'a lame note', 'the end', 'Peter Parkers', 'the key character', 'development', 'progression', 'this.And', 'MCU', 'fashion', 'the film', 'fall flat'], ['Awful humour'], ['Peters', 'Tom', 'Peter'], ['Bad', 'writing', 'finest.Yes', 'this whole movie', 'Peter', 'Doctor Strange', 'a man', 'magic'], ['Strange', 'character', 'the entire film', 'the only one', 'braincell.Overall', 'this movie'], ['MCU', 'Black Widow', 'Shang', 'Spider-man', 'love', 'the character', 'MCU', 'portrayal', 'the character', 'Tom Holland', 'acting']]","[['Review By Kamal KI', 'film'], ['Spider-man characters', 'involvement with Stark', 'Tom', 'Peter', 'Tony Stark', 'mentorship'], ['movie'], ['amount of nostalgia'], ['issues', 'example', 'movie', 'past Peter', 'whole identity', 'moment', 'Daredevil', 'meaningless cameo', 'nobody', 'care', 'blind man', 'brick', 'window'], ['fanservice'], ['rest', 'movie', 'end', 'everything', 'spider-men and villains', 'world', 'course', 'plots', 'previous spider-man movies', 'villains', 'demise'], ['fights', 'spider-man end', 'lame note', 'ordinary men', 'end', 'original battles', 'Peter Parkers', 'character development', 'progression', 'stories from this.And', 'MCU fashion', 'film', 'jokes', 'fall flat'], ['Awful humour', 'serious moments', 'writers', 'jokes', 'whole minutes'], ['Constant tonal shifts', 'jokes', 'Peters', 'Tom', 'Peter'], ['Bad writing', 'finest.Yes', 'whole movie', 'Peter', 'Doctor Strange', 'man', 'magic', 'consequences', 'spells'], ['Strange', 'character', 'entire film', 'only one', 'braincell.Overall', 'movie'], ['MCU movies', 'Black Widow', 'Shang', 'Spider-man movies', 'love', 'character', 'MCU', 'portrayal', 'character', 'Tom Holland', 'acting']]"

8,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Definitely one for the fans...,"Right, well I am by no means a fan of superhero movies, but I will watch them when given the chance. Why? Solely for entertainment purposes, because Marvel Studios does make rather impressive movies, now don't they? Indeed. And that is also why I opted to sit down and watch the 2021 movie ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" here in 2022.Actually, my family went to watch ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" back in 2021 when it was out in the cinema, but I didn't go, as I don't think superhero movies are worth the ticket admission for a cinema. So instead, I opted to watch it when it became readily accessible at the comforts of my home.Writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers actually put together a wholesome enough storyline here for this movie, and sure it was watchable and enjoyable. Outstanding or memorable? No, not so much. But then again, I am not overly keen on the whole superhero genre. But ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" did provide me with entertainment for the 148 minutes that the movie ran for.And it was actually fun enough to watch the various Spider-Men come together on the screen and fight the villains from previous movies all over again. Nostalgia? Perhaps. But at the same time, sort of lazy writing when you think about it.Visually then ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" was phenomenal. But then again, that is what Marvel Studios excel at, isn't it?""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" certainly has a impressive cast list, with a lot of big names. I mean, you have Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire as the Spider-Man, and then you have Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Rhys Ifans and Thomas Haden Church return to reprise their former villainous roles. And the movie also have the likes of talents such as J. K. Simmons, Marisa Tomei, Jon Favreau and such on the cast list as well.It was nice, though, to see that the writers were taking the many previous movies in the franchise with a grain of salt some times throughout the course of the movie, with the puns and snazzy dialogue hinting at and referencing previous movies.""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" definitely is a pleasing movie for the fans of superhero movies and of ""Spider-Man"" in general.My rating of ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" lands on a six out of ten stars.","[['a fan', 'superhero', 'the chance'], [], ['entertainment', 'Marvel Studios'], [], ['movie', 'Way Home', 'family', 'Way Home', 'the cinema', 'the ticket', 'admission', 'a cinema'], ['Chris McKenna', 'Erik Sommers', 'a wholesome enough storyline', 'this movie'], [], [], ['the whole superhero', 'genre'], ['Way Home', 'entertainment', 'the movie', 'for.And', 'the various Spider-Men come', 'the screen'], ['Nostalgia'], [], ['the same time', 'sort', 'lazy', 'Way Home'], ['Marvel Studios', 'excel'], ['Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'a impressive cast', 'list', 'a lot'], ['Tom Holland', 'Andrew Garfield', 'Tobey Maguire', 'Spider-Man', 'Jamie Foxx', 'Willem Dafoe', 'Alfred Molina', 'Rhys', 'Thomas Haden Church', 'return'], ['the movie', 'J.

No Way Home, in my opinion, is even better than Homecoming and Far From Home, and pretty much one of the best MCU movies of all time. It's a simple story, but the execution is fantastic. Even the smallest of surprises have a huge impact, and I could feel that in the theatre as I joined several other Spider-Man fans cheer out for both heroes and villains. The action sequences were brilliant; seeing them in 3D is totally worth the price of admission. Every actor delivered a believable, realistic performance, and especially our lead actor Tom Holland. The visual effects too were top notch and the editing was stupendous. Two and a half hours flew by real quick while watching this popcorn action entertainer.

In this case, it throws the entire kitchen sink including nods to the multiverse.In this one Peter Parker rues the day people discover he is Spiderman. And in order to allow his friends to live a normal life he goes to Dr. Strange to conjure up a spell so he would be forgotten. Seriously. The entire movie is predicated on a stupid wish. Well obviously that goes wrong and a dimension portal opens to different worlds where villains dont recognize the present casted Peter Parker. Seems clever on paper but it is a slog. The only gimmick is that we see Peter Parkers from previous flicks. What you get are momentum killing conversations between the Spideys. Which, for fans, suppose it's great to shoehorn legacy. For people who are too young to know anyone of the previous ones. Im sure theyll be confused.This entire movie moves at a snails pace and suffers from bloat. You can slash a half hour and still be fine. This culminates in the death of Aunt May. Because, if you follow the storylines Spidermans have to have a loved one die at their own stupid decisions.

19,Spider-Man: No Way Home,"A good, not great movie.","This is the best film Marvel has released this year. Shang-Chi was only ok, the Venom sequel was atrocious, Black Widow was so-so, Eternals was bland for the most part. What makes this one work is the cast, but the story really, when examined is weak. The last movie put the writers in a corner while revealing (a silly idea really) Peter's identity to the world. He goes to Doctor Strange without thinking about what he really wants, and ends up, in typical spider-man fashion, in screwing everything up. So, also in usual Spider-Man style, by trying to fix things up, he totally messes up further. In the end this costs him a lot. While this movie starts out well, the middle is dull and why should Peter care about beings from alternate realities? And by 'fixing' them, did he erase the events of those films, making the spider-men of those realities unnecessary? Peter loses everything due to his listening to Aunt May, who's advice is illogical and gets her killed. Well, I can say this was the best of Holland's trilogy, but it still isn't Spider-Man 2. A few sides: Molina, Garfield and Maguire's returns were the best part of this movie. Those three steal every single scene they're in. Dafoe was good as Norman, but I could have done without Electro and Sandman who added little to the story.

20,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Very cool idea; extremely poor plot,"Such a a cool concept and bringing back the other 2 Spider-Man is all we fans wanted / but the story, plot, character motivations and script was not up to the challenge.Biggest flaw is that Spider-Man chose to 'save' these villains (putting everyone's lives at risk) for what reason?

23,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Homeless and restless,"There is so much to unpack here. And I understand that some people may not be into the first 30 minutes or so of the movie, but it is apparent how much almost everyone loves this movie. And as you can tell I am one of them. Now you could dismiss my opinion, since I have clearly bought and swallowed the MCU pill (I openly admit liking and being a fan boy of what has been created there - you can hate me or simply agree with me, all opinions are welcome) ... but I dare anyone who has seen all Spider Man movies, not to feel at least something rather positive about this.It does take many good things from previous efforts (no pun intended) and gets the best out of them. It does a great service to the (movie) history of Spider-Man. But also showing us a different side of a Marvel hero ... a side that is vulnerable in a way we have not seen yet. Or not in that form - the identity crisis and the good deeds that do not go unpunished ... or do they? Tom Holland has been exposed - something you know if you've seen the previous Spider-Man movie ... and while his mentor Iron Man dealt differently with that fame - recognition, Peter Parker as we know him, can not deal with it the same way.Add to that, that he wants to help people as much as he can (a bit of a difference to what Tony Stark stood for most of the time, being self centered and and self serving) - and you have a dangerous combination. There is a reason the Tom Holland Spider-Man movies are being compared with 80s teen comedies - there are many parallels (John Hughes and others are being name dropped in those conversations). And while there is a lot of action (the mirror world scene has so many ""climactic"" scenes I probably did not close my mouth the entire time it was happening), the movie also takes its time to give us little character moments.And a lot of fan service - this movie celebrates what came before. It celebrates and takes its audience seriously. But in a fun and entertaining way. Yes it is not all fun and games and there are a lot of callbacks (no pun intended) - there is drama, there may be even some head shaking at how naive Peter Parker seems ... but it makes sense in the realm of the world that was built around him and the character that he is - there is an evolution, but he can't help himself - being who he is and who he grew up to be. For better or worse ... yes the famous line will be uttered and it will have a sad undertone to it. But the movie is able to give you so much, that even when you know something completely horrible is about to happen, you also know that some lighter moments will follow.That being said, it takes nothing away from the performance by Tom Holland, who has to play vulnerable, playful, ecstatic, experimental, shy and giving/helpful ... while a lot has been made of who is going to be in the movie (or not) - it is his movie. Yes there are many things that you can tear apart and make fun of - there are logic issues if you want to call them that ... but in a world where ""magic"" exists ... are you really going to nitpick? Maybe you will, which would be a shame - because you'll be missing out on one hell of a movie and a ride that is truly amazing - no pun intended.It is also amazing that Sony and Disney reached a deal - so that Marvel can continue to use Spiderman in their universe. But not just him ... it seems there is way more to come. And while having many throwbacks (and callbacks) and bringing them all to a conclusion of sorts ... well while all that could mean that this could be a nice way to end Tom Hollands reign as Spider-Man ... it could just as easily continue. The possibilities are endless going forward.As you can tell I am not one to spoil or say anything that is revealing. That is why I did not talk about the cast and the cameos - most of them were revealed ahead of time. Either officially (villains) or just through rumors (no matter how much denying went on - we knew ... we just knew) ... but there was a cameo that most did not see coming - pun very much intended.If you watched this in a cinema (which I can only highly recommend to do), you will probably still have goosebumps. You either cheered yourself loudly at quite a few moments (or gasped at others) ... or just enjoyed silently ... what a movie experience that was. One that I might repeat in cinemas - a treat I do not give myself too often, because I tend to let a bit of time pass before I rewatch something after the first time viewing ... but there are exceptions and this might very well be one of them ... Spider-Man you Sir ... are one of the good ones!

26,Spider-Man: No Way Home,An Epic Film That Really Delivers,"Finally, the biggest film Spider-Man: No Way Home has hit cinemas and I had to go see it as early as possible. Now I have watched it, here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees Spider-Man's secret identity revealed, he tries to get Doctor Strange's help to fix things but this leads to some unwanted visitors from other universes to cause problems for both of them.Main Character
Tom Holland has played Spider-Man for a while now and for me this is his best performance in the role. You really see how he has grown and this film shows real depth to the character and how he has kind of grown up into this crazy world. He doesn't have much rest in the film and it really pushes Holland to impress in the majority of his scenes and I thought he was great in really making Spider-Man a top hero in The MCU.Supporting Characters
Zendaya plays MJ and I was just really happy to see the dynamic between her and Peter in this film. Despite everything that goes on they are a pretty strong couple and it is just nice for a comic book film to have a relationship that feels natural without overpowering the main plot. Benedict Cumberbatch reprises his role as Doctor Strange and he is really good, I really like how despite being a hero he has a more mature and different viewpoint to Spider-Man. He adds some really interesting parts to the film and plays a unique role in the progress of the story and Spider-Man as a character. Jacob Batalon is back as Ned and he is much better then the role he played in Far From Home. He is just a fun character that supports Peter, he is way more involved with Spider-Man and that improves his character so much. Marisa Tomei is back as Aunt May and again she is more involved this time out and is just a really great person for Holland to bounce off and the dynamic just really works and makes their relationship feel very real. Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina and Jamie Foxx reprise their roles as Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus and Electro. Dafoe and Molina are great and really flourish in their roles, but the surprise is Foxx as Max Dillon/Electro. He is so much better then he was in Amazing Spider-Man 2 and I am glad he got given this 2nd chance here.Story
The story is really great, I was worried with all of the multiverse elements that the focus could have been taken off of a character arc for Spider-Man but it nails this element. Peter has a real arc and it develops incredibly well and for me was a real highlight. It is obviously great seeing the returning villains and they are treated with respect and their characters are further explored. The ending feels deserved and because you are so invested it feels really earnt.Script
MCU films often get criticised for their scripts including too much humour in them, but I actually think the balance is really handled well here. Yes there are funny moments here but for me they didn't outweigh the serious and darker parts of the film.Style
The film looks great, the actions scenes are all really fun and seeing The MCU Spider-Man going against villains from the other franchises works very well and allows for some fun sequences. The pacing for the film is also really good, despite being 2 hours 30 mins it never felt too long and I honestly believe that there isn't really any filler here which is an impressive feat.Overall
Overall, Spider-Man: No Way Home is an epic film that really lives up to the hype. I am possibly still buzzing because I have just watched the film but I can't find too much fault and this is a Spider-Man fans dream film and anybody will find this film plenty of fun.Rating - 10/10.","[['film', 'Spider-Man', 'Way Home'], ['review', 'the film'], ['The premise', 'the film', 'Spider-Man', 'secret identity', 'Doctor Strange', 'help', 'them.Main', 'Character Tom Holland', 'Spider-Man', 'a while', 'performance', 'the role'], ['this film', 'real depth', 'the character', 'kind', 'this crazy world'], ['much rest', 'the film', 'Holland', 'the majority', 'Spider-Man', 'a top hero', 'MCU.Supporting Characters Zendaya', 'MJ', 'the dynamic', 'Peter', 'this film'], ['everything', 'strong couple', 'a comic book', 'film', 'a relationship', 'the main plot'], ['Benedict Cumberbatch', 'role', 'Doctor Strange', 'a hero', 'different viewpoint', 'Spider-Man'], ['the film', 'a unique role', 'the progress', 'the story', 'Spider-Man', 'a character'], ['Jacob Batalon', 'Ned', 'the role', 'Far From Home'], ['a fun', 'character', 'Peter', 'way', 'Spider-Man', 'character'], ['Marisa Tomei', 'Aunt May', 'this time', 'great person', 'Holland', 'relationship'], ['Willem Dafoe', 'Alfred Molina', 'Jamie Foxx', 'Green Goblin', 'Doctor Octopus', 'Electro'], ['Dafoe', 'Molina', 'the surprise', 'Foxx', 'Max Dillon/Electro'], ['Amazing', 'chance', 'here.Story', 'The story', 'the multiverse', 'the focus', 'a character', 'arc', 'Spider-Man', 'this element'], ['Peter', 'a real arc', 'a real highlight'], ['the returning', 'respect'], ['MCU', 'much humour', 'the balance'], ['darker', 'the film.Style', 'The film', 'MCU Spider-Man', 'some fun'], ['The pacing', 'the film', 'any filler', 'an impressive feat.Overall', 'Overall', 'Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'an epic', 'film', 'the hype'], ['the film', 'much fault', 'dream', 'film', 'anybody', 'this film', 'plenty']]","[['film Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'cinemas'], ['review', 'film'], ['premise', 'film', 'Spider-Man', 'secret identity', 'Doctor Strange', 'help', 'things', 'unwanted visitors', 'other universes', 'problems', 'them.Main Character Tom Holland', 'Spider-Man', 'while', 'performance', 'role'], ['film', 'real depth', 'character', 'kind', 'crazy world'], ['much rest', 'film', 'Holland', 'majority', 'scenes', 'Spider-Man', 'top hero', 'MCU.Supporting Characters Zendaya', 'MJ', 'dynamic', 'Peter', 'film'], ['everything', 'strong couple', 'book film', 'relationship', 'main plot'], ['Benedict Cumberbatch', 'role as Doctor Strange', 'hero', 'different viewpoint', 'Spider-Man'], ['interesting parts', 'film', 'unique role', 'progress', 'story and Spider-Man', 'character'], ['Jacob Batalon', 'Ned', 'role', 'Far From Home'], ['fun character', 'Peter', 'way', 'Spider-Man', 'character'], ['Marisa Tomei', 'Aunt May', 'time', 'person for Holland', 'relationship'], ['Willem Dafoe', 'Alfred Molina', 'Jamie Foxx', 'roles as Green Goblin', 'Doctor Octopus', 'Electro'], ['Dafoe and Molina', 'roles', 'surprise', 'Foxx as Max Dillon/Electro'], ['Amazing', 'chance here.Story', 'story', 'multiverse', 'focus', 'character arc', 'Spider-Man', 'element'], ['Peter', 'real arc', 'real highlight'], ['returning villains', 'respect', 'characters'], ['feels', 'MCU films', 'scripts', 'much humour', 'balance'], ['funny moments', 'darker parts', 'film.Style', 'film', 'actions scenes', 'MCU Spider-Man', 'villains', 'other franchises', 'fun sequences'], ['pacing', 'film', 'hours', 'mins', 'filler', 'feat.Overall Overall', 'Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'epic film', 'hype'], ['film', 'much fault', 'fans dream film', 'anybody', 'film plenty']]"

32,Spider-Man: No Way Home,In no way good,"It might be the worst movie ever made. Not just because it is bad, but because of the misuse of all the resources that went into making it.I will be the first to admit that I have propensity to look for meaning when I am watching a film. Be it the straight-forward moral of the story or a higher meaning, something to make you think. That is how I enjoy cinema the most, when it gives me something to think about. Big or small. When the images on the screen are about something more than simply the images on the screen.This film is the complete opposite of it. Its meaning is inward-looking. It is not interested of looking at anything other than itself. It is complete and utter navel-gazing. That really is the crux of the film. That is the reason why this is barely watchable. Every flaw and mistake comes from this movie's own excessive self-contemplation.Where to put the blame is a different question. It has been established for some time that these MCU films are not ""directed"". There is no singular vision behind them and it boils down to an assembly line. The plot and dialogue are so bad I can't imagine anyone put any amount of thought into it. All the lines do actually feel like ad-libs the actors improvised on the day. Visually there is an absence of flair (and I am being generous) which is on par for the course for these movies by now. The soundtrack and sound design is, of course, forgettable. The editing is conventional. The set design is reminiscent of those real-estate videos where celebrities show their homes. The costume design is ok, again which is not shocking knowing the means that were allocated to this.The acting could have been the saving grace of the movie. Unfortunately, Tom Holland, Zendaya and Jacob Batalon are the stars of the film. And while their performances are good, they usually have to share the screen with (multiple) Oscar-winners. It is jarring to see the best talent doing what is basically glorified background work. That is why this is the worst movie of all time. You have a film packed with the best actors working today, but we have to follow Tom Holland's inane struggle on how to apply to some college.I am not even sure I want to go into the plot. In truth it does not matter. I suspect that even the makers of this took that as a given. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has now morphed into a never ending reference and call-backs machine. That is the core of this film: ""remember this?!"" The structure of it is one of a TV show, except in TV there is an A-plot and a B-plot. This film is all B-plot.As I am writing this, this film has been viewed by millions and is one of the highest grossing movies of all time.

33,Spider-Man: No Way Home,"Energetic and Colorful, But Also Meandering and Overloaded","Instantly loathing the publicity of being outed by the press, Spider-Man hits up the Sanctum Sanctorum to ask Dr. Strange for some mystical assistance. They cast a spell of wiped memory and screw it up, reality is torn, familiar faces invade different spaces... you know this, you've seen the trailer. It's the Sony/MCU equivalent of X-Men: Days of Future Past, with a stream of old band members coming out of retirement for a jam-packed farewell concert.One might hope that the results are a smidge better than that old X-Men reunion, and they are, but No Way Home also suffers from many of the same problems. Primarily, the overwhelming urge to stuff as much crap on the screen as possible, even when the audience is already exhausted. It tries to serve too many masters and, in the end, sufficiently serves none. There's fun to be had, especially when the oddball mix-and-match super-characters get the chance to escape the trappings of a broader storyline and simply converse as individuals. Those accessible human interactions have been a big strength for the two preceding Marvel Spider-Man flicks, and they reap great benefits here, each time the old guard mingles with the new.I wish we had more such moments, but the push to turn the MCU's most grounded franchise into another big-time tent pole attraction demands otherwise. In reaching for the next major event, they've overlooked the ""neighborhood"" part of ""Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man."" Actually, they might've forgotten the ""friendly"" part, too, because there's a whole bunch of angst spinning around Tom Holland's central performance. But that's more excusable: Peter Parker goes through a lot over the course of this hundred-fifty minutes, he progresses and matures as a character, and he's experienced equally dark times in the comics.No, the performances aren't the issue here, nor is the dialogue, which remains snappy and delightful. The primary culprit is the plot, bloating and careening in indeterminate (and often mindless) directions, making a lot of noise but not making a lot of sense. Dr. Strange hand-waves many explanations under the guise of mysticism, which is basically his thing, but so do the various Spider-Men. Important members of the supporting cast are marginalized and under-served. The city of New York, once an essential ingredient, is now barely a backdrop. Goalposts are moved, overshadowed, and then moved again. Rumor has it that script re-writes were still underway during filming, and it shows.This is messy. Lots of fun on certain occasions, but stifling and sludgy in others. It's a mixed bag, leaning more to the positive than the negative, but I don't know that I'm content with the way everything wraps up in the end. Where Homecoming and Far From Home both left me charged and anxious for the next step, No Way Home put me in a place of quiet acceptance.

34,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Sincerely Disappointing and Objectively Pointless,"When Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire enter the movie, the cinema rightfully erupts into a hail of cheers and applause. The experience of Spider-Man: No Way Home is bizarre. Not only do you spend half the runtime just waiting for the return of a familiar face, but grow weary of the current cast which've headlined the previous MCU entires. Tom Holland, Zendaya and Jacob Batalon cannot hope to carry a film on its own terms, therefore No Way Home relies and depends on the presence of legacy. Far From Home (2019) was borderline unwatchable. Cheap-looking, tone-deaf and accompanied by a forced, cringeworthy romance (which doesn't improve here by the way) it is surely the worst Spider-Man movie of all time. This threequel holds the unfortunate title of runner-up. It shares many of the same problems...First of all; technicalities. As with most MCU movies, the cinematography is flat and the colour palette is dulled for no apparent reason. The action set-pieces aren't very inventive and hold no iconography, always taking place on a boring, painfully obvious green-screened environment. Why does the Statue of Liberty look like that!? Why has the Lizard's design regressed from 2012, and why do they recycle and super-impose B-Roll footage of Thomas Hayden Church as Sandman, or Rhys Ifans as Curt Conners? It's so lazy.Aunt May's death barely affects me emotionally, because thus far she's been portrayed as this bubbly, whimsical character with very few scenes of actual conviction. Can you imagine if this was Rosemary Harris or Sally Fields' Aunt May? The difference in my reaction would be night and day. Moral of the story, don't cast the most gorgeous woman alive as Aunt May... Speaking of conviction, why does this film feel the need to inject a cheap gag whenever it's in proximity to a remotely serious scene? These screenwriters have to go back to basics, and refresh themselves on the fundamentals of tone. Not to mention, most of the MCU's humour so infrequently lands, and caters to the lowest common denominator audiences. That's not to say there aren't a few smart quips here or there, but for the most part, I was confused by the amount of chuckles surrounding me.No Way Home is, clinically, a bad movie. Take for instance, the First Act. Much of the world wants Spider-Man hunted down and defeated. He's interrogated once, and then freed on behalf of a pointless cameo by Daredevil himself, Matthew Murdock. Like, what? There's no ramifications. He just gets to live his life despite being an enemy of the state. Does the world think he partook in a terrorist plot or do they think he snatched a candy from a convenience store? I'm a little confused. I guess the consequence is that Ned and MJ don't get into MIT... Big deal. I don't care. These are poorly written characters. Bring on the multiverse villains!What can I say on that front..? I was grinning from ear-to-ear in seeing Dr. Octopus (Alfred Molina), Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) and Electro (Jamie Foxx) back again. Hearing their musical cues gave me goosebumps, as did some of their dialogues... It's a testament to the actors. There's some serious talent in The Sinister Six. I love their interactions. For a second you'll think to yourself how cool it all is, how you should just be thankful a film like this is even possible... But again, why have it at all if it isn't done correctly? Take for instance, the final battle, with one of the glaring objective errors of the film... Tobey's swingin' around, pulling off epic Spidey stunts, and there's no hint of Danny Elfman's beautiful theme... Same goes for Andrew Garfield, who had the privilege of having two great themes by James Horner and Hans Zimmer respectively. What was Michael Giacchino thinking!? He already dabbled in old themes for the villains, so why not for the heroes? If the movie is dead-set on fan-service and and legacy (which it most certainly is) then why on Earth not include these terrific tunes? Instead we just get orchestral renditions of Tom Holland's theme, which utterly PALES in comparison! It's just the same progression of notes.On to the Spider-Men themselves... Andrew Garfield has probably solidified himself as my favourite after watching this, while Tobey Maguire remains legendary by default since he was my childhood Spidey. Tom Holland doesn't come close. I never liked him in the role because he's not tangible. He's too pure and honest; thereby becoming illegitimate as a realistic humanistic interpretation. For whatever reason, Tobey Maguire gets stabbed, fatally it seems, by the Green Goblin. Thing is, he survives... So why bother scaring us? The moment doesn't serve a purpose, other than to provide a sudden, stupid shock for the poor audience. Ultimately, each of the villains fade away, back to their own universes. It's totally anti-climactic, not to mention there's no rematch or even a solid dialogue exchange between the Green Goblin and Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man. Malpractice from a storytelling standpoint; odd, considering that on the other hand you have a terrific scene where Andrew's Spider-Man catches MJ from falling to her death, as he failed to do so with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014)... Does narrative closure not apply to all facets of these films? Or did the writers just get forgetful for Tobey? Either way, the ending leaves much to be desired and leaves you wondering: what was the point?Individually, scenes work well. But this isn't a clip show. It's a film. To conclude, No Way Home is a mess. One which nearly totally collapses prior to Andrew and Tobey's appearance. Their scenes are fantastic, and all criticisms aside for one minute, I am grateful I got to see 'em on the big screen one last time. I love it when they bond over shared losses, and Andrew and Tobey's little exchange in the lab... No Way Home is an occasional treat, however nonsensical and pointless on the whole.","[['Andrew Garfield', 'Tobey Maguire', 'the movie', 'the cinema', 'a hail', 'applause'], ['The experience',

35,Spider-Man: No Way Home,A Movie For Children,"It took me a while to get around to watching No Way Home. There was so much hype, and people were declaring 'the hype is real.'I feel alone on an island thinking this movie is terrible. I get that people were psyched about all the old Spider-Man characters coming together for a big super fun time, but that does not cover up for how nonsensical everything is in this film. (Spoilers incoming)First the good. This will be a short segment. The idea to bring all the characters from the previous Spider-Man movies together through the multiverse is an awesome concept. The execution however was lazily conceived.The two constant problems in the movie are the cringey dialogue and the incomprehensible decision making. The movie starts with Peter Parker's identity being revealed. Now if your identity is revealed where is the last place you want to go? The answer is your house. It appears no one told the writers this because that is where Parker goes. Also, Parker ask's Strange to put a spell on the world so his friends can go to MIT? How is that his rationale? Yes it gives purpose for the rest of the film but it's a lazy story telling way to get there. Why would Dr. Strange agree at all to that. He is a freaking wizard.There is not a single line of dialogue that is intelligent. It's all cliches, lines that have been in previous movies, or just pop culture language with no substance. Towards the end I was cringing at the back and forth between characters, especially when Goblin says ""I'm something of a scientist myself."" Yes we know that when you said it 20 years ago. (I loathe fan service.) There were a couple jokes that landed but overall I was laughing at parts that weren't supposed to be funny, like when all the Peter Parkers were in the lab with their goggles and test-tubes finding cures for the villains in less than 5 minutes. Again, lazy writing.This is a movie for children who have no concept of reality or care about a well thought out story.

39,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Super holiday entertainment loaded with visual and spiritual meaning.,"Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to Peter (Tom Holland): ""The problem is you trying to live two different lives. The longer you do it, the more dangerous it becomes!""Notwithstanding the ""home"" in the title, the exciting new Spider-Man: No Way Home is more about the existential need to create one's own identity, the Christian need to give up a life in order to gain it, and the human need for a second chance. Many super-hero movies continue to emphasize the hero's need to recover a parent or child even more than the need to sacrifice for the good of humankind.As Peter Parker (Tom Holland) struggles with the attention he gets because Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) revealed his identity, he gets involved with Dr. Strange to erase his super-hero identity from everyone's memory. Fooling with Mother Nature never is good in these hyper-active fantasies, and it's true as Peter tries to get Dr. Strange to reverse his initial memory-erasing spell in order to remain in the minds of those he loves.Besides, what director Jon Watts and his writers are really interested in is pulling the three Spidies together (Holland, Andrew Garfield, Tobey Maguire) to remediate former bad boys like The Sandman (Thomas Hayden Church), Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), Electro (Jamie Foxx), and Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). Dr. Strange clears the way between parallel dimensions to let each Spidey's version of villains to come together for their cleansing.The imaginative and entertaining concept of getting these characters together proves not to be confusing but revealing of their generous natures and the benign fraternity of Spider-Men, adding the collaboration motif into their otherwise solitary lives.Although the digital gymnastics are impressive, beyond those is an attempt to flesh out character for both good and bad boys. Discoveries abound without super sentimentality or long exposition. Because the filmmakers have taken care to load meaning into most dialogue, the revealing third act takes the plot to dizzying heights while character spills out along the way.As more is found out about the heroes and the villains, the long road back to normalcy for Peter seems just about right, filled as it is with triumphs that come from working as a team (not a normal Spidey thing to do) to suffering the loss of dear ones to a better cause. It's a coming of age at any age and a satisfying display of character development that might be envied by indie films everywhere whose bread and butter is a similar attempt to show humans at their worst and best.Super holiday fare, yes; challenging, yes; amazed I am that comic-book stuff holds meaning amidst its visual splendor, yes.","[['Doctor Strange', 'Benedict Cumberbatch', 'Peter', 'Tom Holland', 'The problem'], [], ['home', 'the title', 'Way Home', 'the existential need', 'own identity', 'Christian', 'need', 'a life', 'order', 'the human need', 'a second chance'], ['the hero', 'need', 'a parent', 'the need', 'humankind.As', 'Peter Parker', 'Tom Holland', 'the attention', 'Mysterio', 'Jake Gyllenhaal', 'identity', 'Dr'], ['super-hero identity', 'everyone', 'memory'], ['Mother Nature', 'Peter', 'Dr'], ['Strange', 'initial memory-erasing', 'spell', 'order', 'director', 'Jon Watts', 'Holland', 'Andrew Garfield', 'Tobey Maguire', 'Sandman', 'Thomas Hayden Church', 'Doc Ock', 'Alfred Molina', 'Electro', 'Jamie Foxx', 'Green Goblin', 'Willem Dafoe'], ['Dr'], ['the way', 'Spidey', 'version', 'cleansing.The', 'imaginative', 'concept', 'the benign fraternity', 'Spider-Men', 'the collaboration', 'motif', 'otherwise', 'an attempt', 'character'], ['super sentimentality', 'long exposition'], ['care', 'dialogue', 'third act', 'the plot', 'character', 'the way.As', 'the long road', 'normalcy', 'Peter', 'triumphs', 'a team', 'Spidey', 'thing', 'the loss', 'cause'], ['age', 'any age', 'a satisfying display', 'character', 'development', 'bread', 'butter', 'a similar attempt', 'best.Super holiday', 'fare', 'comic-book', 'stuff', 'visual splendor']]","[['Doctor Strange', 'Benedict Cumberbatch', 'Peter', 'Tom Holland', 'problem', 'different lives'], [], ['home', 'title', 'Way Home', 'existential need', 'own identity', 'Christian need', 'life in order', 'human need', 'second chance'], ['Many super-hero movies', 'hero', 'need', 'parent', 'need', 'humankind.As Peter Parker', 'Tom Holland', 'attention', 'Mysterio', 'Jake Gyllenhaal', 'identity', 'Dr'], ['identity from everyone', 'memory'], ['Mother Nature', 'hyper-active fantasies', 'Peter', 'Dr'], ['Strange', 'memory-erasing spell', 'order', 'minds', 'director Jon Watts', 'writers', 'Spidies', 'Holland', 'Andrew Garfield', 'Tobey Maguire', 'former bad boys', 'Sandman', 'Thomas Hayden Church', 'Doc Ock', 'Alfred Molina', 'Electro', 'Jamie Foxx', 'Green Goblin', 'Willem Dafoe'], ['Dr'], ['way', 'parallel dimensions', 'Spidey', 'version of villains', 'cleansing.The imaginative', 'concept', 'characters', 'generous natures', 'fraternity of Spider-Men', 'collaboration motif', 'otherwise', 'digital gymnastics', 'attempt', 'character', 'bad boys'], ['Discoveries', 'super sentimentality', 'long exposition'], ['filmmakers', 'care', 'dialogue', 'third act', 'plot', 'heights while character', 'way.As', 'heroes', 'villains', 'long road', 'normalcy for Peter', 'triumphs', 'team', 'Spidey thing', 'loss', 'dear ones', 'cause'], ['age', 'age', 'display of character development', 'indie films', 'bread and butter', 'similar attempt', 'humans', 'holiday fare', 'comic-book stuff', 'visual splendor']]"

44,Spider-Man: No Way Home,SpideyVerse,"Went to see this opening day to avoid spoilers and boy was i pleased i did. Going in not knowing what was going to happen made the movie so much better. Seeing Andrew Garfield, Tobey Maguire & Tom Holland all together really is a fans dream and Marvel are giving so much fan service in all their movies lately it really is staggering.I feel most of all, the movie does well in giving Andrew Garfield some love as the Spider-Man character as he mostly gets a raw deal these days as his movies weren't as strong as Raimi's or MCU ones. Andrew Garfield was a good Peter Parker & Spider-Man, he just didn't get that film where he could really shine and this movie practically says as much.Managing to get so many villains to reprise their roles must have been a tall order (i was more surprised to see Thomas Hayden Church back than anyone).The story grips you right from the off as it takes place immediately after the second one & some of the twists and turns i found quite shocking (i should have known better about Aunt May but it still took me by surprise).The ending is really beautiful in a nice sort of way, seeing Peter interact with MJ after the fact is a real heartstring puller. It ends with a conclusion to the trilogy whilst leaving the door ajar for more Tom Holland Spider-Man movies (which if there is any justice, there will be).Tom Hardy's cameo at the end sets up Venom (or at the very least, a version of) to join the MCU, which should be a blast. The idea of Tom Hardy & Holland playing off of each other is cinematic gold.All in all, i think this is the strongest MCU Spider-Man movie and may be the ultimate one for massive Spider-Man fans. Sam Raimi could never have imagined 20 years ago whilst making Spider-Man (2002) that his characters would be still portraying themselves all these years later in the biggest cinematic universe and franchise ever, truly remarkable, just like this film.","[['Went', 'this opening day', 'boy', 'i pleased i'], ['the movie'], ['Andrew Garfield', 'Tobey Maguire', 'Tom Holland', 'dream', 'Marvel', 'much fan', 'service', 'staggering.I feel', 'the movie', 'Andrew Garfield', 'some love', 'the Spider-Man character', 'a raw deal', 'Raimi', 'MCU'], ['Andrew Garfield', 'Peter Parker', 'Spider-Man', 'that film', 'this movie', 'a tall order', 'i', 'Thomas Hayden Church', 'anyone', 'story', 'place', 'i', 'i', 'Aunt May', 'surprise', '.The', 'a nice sort', 'way', 'Peter', 'interact', 'MJ', 'the fact', 'a real heartstring', 'puller'], ['a conclusion', 'the trilogy', 'whilst', 'the door', 'ajar', 'Tom Holland Spider-Man', 'any justice', '.Tom Hardy', 'cameo', 'the end', 'Venom', 'a version', 'MCU', 'a blast'], ['The idea', 'Tom Hardy', 'Holland', 'cinematic gold.All', 'MCU Spider-Man movie', 'the ultimate one'], ['Sam Raimi', 'Spider-Man', 'cinematic universe', 'franchise', 'this film']]","[['Went', 'opening day', 'spoilers and boy', 'i pleased i'], ['movie'], ['Andrew Garfield', 'Tobey Maguire', 'Tom Holland', 'fans dream', 'Marvel', 'fan service', 'movies', 'staggering.I feel', 'movie', 'Andrew Garfield', 'love', 'Spider-Man character', 'raw deal', 'days', 'movies', 'Raimi', 'MCU ones'], ['Andrew Garfield', 'Peter Parker', 'Spider-Man', 'film', 'movie', 'many villains', 'roles', 'tall order', 'i', 'Thomas Hayden Church', 'anyone', 'story grips', 'place', 'twists', 'i', 'i', 'Aunt May', 'surprise', '.The', 'sort of way', 'Peter interact', 'MJ', 'fact', 'heartstring puller'], ['conclusion', 'trilogy whilst', 'door ajar', 'Tom Holland Spider-Man movies', 'justice', '.Tom Hardy', 'cameo', 'end', 'Venom', 'version', 'MCU', 'blast'], ['idea of Tom Hardy', 'Holland', 'cinematic gold.All', 'MCU Spider-Man movie', 'ultimate one', 'massive Spider-Man fans'], ['Sam Raimi', 'years', 'Spider-Man', 'characters', 'years', 'cinematic universe and franchise', 'film']]"
45,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Best Holland's Spider-Man and a crowd pleasing milestone to the MCU,"I do not think this is a totally perfect film: It is too damn easily to spoil it, probably the middle section is not as powerful as the start and the epic finale, some of the characters are thrown into the plot rather than enjoy a well developed evolution like Peter Parker himself and I was not exactly a fan of Holland's era due to a lackluster couple of previous solo films. But this third solo movie is his best film to date, one of the most impactful MCU & Superhero movies and one outing that redeems and answers all my complaints regarding what came before.Here, MCU's Peter Parker finally shows some cracks and faces true trauma, developing a true commitment to his own adventure even being extremely populated by plenty of beloved and nostalgic other ones. Here, Parker's Spider-Man finally gets to grown in me, being faithful to the source and ending his evolution within Avengers universe on a riprousingly high.

46,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Mid 8/10,"Although this movie has some horrible pacing, especially in the film's first half, where some scenes feel so abrupt, with that said, this movie slaps harder than me testing a fresh watermelon. I don't want to go in-depth cause there is a lot to unpack in this film. So I will say that this is one of the best Spider-Man adaptations and one of the most important. This movie has an excellent balance of humor and tragedy, heroism and villainy, and the vast characters this film brings.

47,Spider-Man: No Way Home,One of the best experiences,This was one of the most impressive cinema experiences I ever had. Spider-Man: No Way Home really had it all. I still have no words for what I just witnessed.Amazing.,"[['impressive cinema'], ['Spider-Man', 'Way Home'], []]","[['cinema experiences'], ['Spider-Man', 'Way Home'], ['words']]"
48,Spider-Man: No Way Home,I wanted to like this,"I watched this with no prior knowledge of the plot. I had heard rumours but not enough, so each cameo was a genuine surprise for me. Even with that element, I was left dejected.Why? Well, first of all it made no sense. It seemed a ridiculously contrived way of bringing back old villains and actors just for the nostalgia and fan nods without any real premise. It makes no sense that the all powerful all knowing Dr Strange would risk the stability of the universe to get a few kids into college. He knows far too much about actions and consequences to fall into that trap.And Peter's ridiculous idea to save the villains he doesn't know, who belong in another universe, and who have done despicable things to his own alter egos, using what...some science stuff that just happens to be in Happy's apartment? We never know quite how he builds these ""cures"", we just get blinded by movie science talk enough to understand that it's ""science"". Just like Peter trapping Dr Strange in the Mirror Dimension by using ""math"". It's like those old 80s movies where a computer whiz taps random things into a computer and it can do amazing things! How? We don't know, just shut up and eat your popcorn!The dialogue fell oddly flat too. I'm a Marvel fan and I enjoy the witty banter, one liners and emotional moments but this fell way short for me. The jokes weren't funny. The interplay between characters felt written by a kid trying to emulate Marvel wit. I just didn't feel it. The 3 Peters answering to Ned calling their name was just rubbish. It simply wasn't funny.And the sentimentality felt forced and false. They all cried so many times. Soaring music over the top. Tears and hugs and therapy. It descended into pathetic, and I didn't want to see good characters being pathetic. I get the angst and pain in previous movies but this was pointless and Peter literally destroyed everything including his last remaining family member over nothing. At least the other Peters' regrets were real. This was borne out of pure nonsensical decision making. He wanted to kill The Green Goblin. Why? He was only there because of Peter making ridiculous choices and Aunt May only died because she was as stupid and misguided as Peter. He was just doing what villains do given half a chance - a chance Peter gave him for no logical reason.The fact he saved them in the end was irrelevant and actually did a massive disservice to the previous movies. It devalues what those other Peters did and went through. You may as well cure them too by stopping them getting bitten by spiders in the first place if you're going to be that kind hearted and change history.Would those villains really want to go back to their universe a changed person anyway? They were flawed, broken and destroyed everything they loved. Now they get to go back all ""fixed""...to what? A broken destroyed world they ruined to no doubt face justice for it. Great, thanks Peter! I think their glorious deaths would have been better. Or are the other Spidermen supposed to smooth it all over when they return?And last but not least, the whole ""forget everyone knows who Spider-Man is"" thing is just crazy. As if Dr Strange hasn't learned enough from trying to do it the first time. Why forget Peter Parker completely? Why not just forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man so he keeps his friends etc? So there was Happy at Aunt May's grave not knowing this was her nephew? That makes no sense at all. What happened at the Statue of Liberty then? What did MJ and Ned remember?I came out of the theatre disappointed. It wasn't like MJ said. I actually expected not to be disappointed, which made it worse.","[['no prior knowledge', 'the plot'], ['each cameo', 'a genuine surprise'], ['that element'], ['no sense'], ['contrived way', 'the nostalgia', 'fan', 'any real premise'], ['no sense', 'Dr Strange', 'the stability', 'the universe', 'college'], ['Peter', 'ridiculous idea', 'another universe', 'own alter', 'some science', 'stuff', 'Happy', 'apartment'], ['movie', 'science', 'talk', 'science'], ['Peter', 'Dr Strange', 'Mirror Dimension', 'math'], ['a computer', 'whiz', 'a computer'], [], ['popcorn', 'The dialogue'], ['Marvel', 'fan', 'the witty banter', 'way'], [], ['The interplay', 'a kid', 'Marvel', 'wit'], [], ['Peters', 'Ned', 'name'], ['the sentimentality'], [], ['music'], ['therapy'], [], ['the angst', 'pain', 'pointless', 'Peter', 'everything', 'last remaining family', 'member', 'nothing'], ['Peters'], ['pure nonsensical decision', 'making'], ['Green Goblin'], [], ['Peter', 'Aunt May', 'Peter'], ['a chance', 'a chance', 'Peter', 'no logical reason.The', 'fact', 'the end', 'a massive disservice'], ['Peters'], ['the first place', 'kind', 'change', 'universe', 'person'], ['everything'], [], ['A broken destroyed world', 'no doubt', 'face', 'justice'], ['Great', 'Peter'], [], ['Spidermen', 'everyone', 'thing'], ['Dr Strange', 'the first time'], ['Peter Parker'], ['Peter Parker', 'Spider-Man'], ['Aunt May', 'grave', 'nephew'], ['no sense'], ['Statue', 'Liberty'], ['MJ', 'Ned', 'the theatre'], ['MJ'], []]","[['prior knowledge', 'plot'], ['rumours', 'cameo', 'genuine surprise'], ['element'], ['sense'], ['contrived way', 'old villains and actors', 'nostalgia', 'fan nods', 'real premise'], ['sense', 'Dr Strange', 'stability', 'universe', 'kids into college'], ['actions and consequences', 'Peter', 'ridiculous idea', 'villains', 'universe', 'despicable things', 'alter egos', 'science stuff', 'Happy', 'apartment'], ['cures', 'movie science talk', 'science'], ['Peter', 'Dr Strange', 'Mirror Dimension', 'math'], ['movies', 'computer whiz taps', 'random things', 'computer', 'amazing things'], [], ['popcorn', 'dialogue'], ['Marvel fan', 'witty banter', 'liners', 'emotional moments', 'way'], ['jokes'], ['interplay between characters', 'kid', 'Marvel wit'], [], ['Peters', 'Ned', 'name'], ['sentimentality'], ['many times'], ['music'], ['Tears and hugs', 'therapy'], ['good characters'], ['angst and pain', 'previous movies', 'pointless and Peter', 'everything', 'family member', 'nothing'], ['other Peters', 'regrets'], ['decision making'], ['Green Goblin'], [], ['Peter', 'ridiculous choices', 'Aunt May', 'Peter'], ['chance', 'chance Peter', 'reason.The fact', 'end', 'massive disservice', 'previous movies'], ['other Peters'], ['spiders', 'first place', 'kind', 'change', 'villains', 'universe', 'person'], ['everything'], [], ['broken destroyed world', 'doubt face justice'], ['Great', 'thanks Peter'], ['glorious deaths'], ['other Spidermen', 'everyone knows', 'thing'], ['Dr Strange', 'first time'], ['Peter Parker'], ['Peter Parker', 'Spider-Man', 'friends'], ['Aunt May', 'grave', 'nephew'], ['sense'], ['Statue of Liberty'], ['MJ and Ned', 'theatre'], ['like MJ'], []]"

50,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Sad and mindless 2.5 hrs,"I feel sad to be living in a time where a movie like this can get high ratings. This movie is for low-attention-span adrenaline-immuned viewers, which unfortunately there are more and more of. Unless you are a group of teenagers looking for a night-out, I would not recommend this movie at all.I didn't expect much from this movie other to be an entertaining comic-book-like story. Boy, was I disappointed. It has been no more than a collection of random fight scenes with incoherent story and almost random dialogues in-between. Also, I think the casting of Spider-man, M. J. and Aunt May are just horrible. Tom Holland appears to have the brain of a 10-year old, and Zendaya is great in other films, but as MJ she just doesn't work, same goes for Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) she looks way too young, flirty and brainless, exact opposite of what this character should be.Overall it is a slaughterhouse to everything that spider-man should stand for. It is concentrated around universes and egocentric personal problems instead of being a moral model of real-world problems. The 2.5 hours long movie seem to just be an adrenaline shot one after the other, no substance and nothing to learn from. I'm sadden by having to write this, the production quality is great but where is a plot, a moral and generally being a better person.

But Spider-man has had a special place in my heart since a kid so I had to watch, especially after hearing rumours. To tell the truth, this exceeded my expectations with great power.With surprisingly good acting and great emotionally loaded scenes, No Way Home managed to capture something many Marvel movies fail. Emotions. This was not only an action-packed movie but also a story-driven movie with fantastic execution. Tom Holland and Zendaya as well as other actors managed to deliver acting never seen in the Marvel universe before.No Way Home captured that heart of the first couple of Spider-man trilogy which I think old fans will admire.

56,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Might be the best Spider-Man movie till date! Even if it's not perfect.,"I just watched the movie at the theatre and you really don't wanna miss this one out. I will make it simple, the movie will live to your expectations If not exceed them, however, during the first half of the film you won't witness anything new. Every fight scene is in the trailer and I LITREALLY mean every fight scene. But don't get me wrong they were awesome and of course not the whole fight scenes. It's also full of talking and a bit more funny lines than usual. You also have a very very silly plot that was based on some character's opinion and lead to all the events of the film and then comes on of the best plots and entrances near the beginning of the second half that you will ever witness and here comes the second half of the movie and trust me it was beyond awesome. The VFX of this film is breathtaking. Every action sequence is very complicated and loaded with tons of details. The visuals are insaaane. You also have a couple of Spidy suits and most importantly you won't be disappointed with anything you might be expecting. You have Dr. Strange and believe me it was one of the best times you will see him along with another hero cause Benedict is such a great actor. Zendaya role however was meaningless but you know she is Spidy's GF. The Finale of the film is beyond great and feels like a dream come true for all fans around the world that will leave you full of emotions, amazed and shocked! Even the two post credit scenes made everyone yell in the theatre (who yelled for more than half of the movie). Not a perfect movie and a lot of things may not make sense and will make your brain full of questions like Endgame and that's what make a movie a great one. I have now experienced the whole trilogy at the theatre and there is no doubt that this one is the best. I hope you just relax and enjoy it cause as a fan I'd give it a 10/10 easily but a solid 9/10 with love and joy is fair enough.","[['the movie', 'the theatre', 'out'], ['the movie', 'the first half', 'the film', 'anything'], ['Every fight', 'scene', 'the trailer', 'every fight', 'scene'], ['course', 'the whole fight'], ['a bit'], ['plot', 'some character', 'opinion', 'lead', 'the film', 'the beginning', 'the second half', 'the second half', 'the movie'], ['VFX', 'this film'], ['Every action', 'sequence'], ['insaaane'], ['a couple', 'Spidy', 'anything'], [], ['another hero', 'cause', 'Benedict', 'a great actor'], ['Zendaya', 'role', 'Spidy', 'GF'], ['Finale', 'the film', 'a dream', 'come', 'the world'], ['post', 'credit', 'everyone', 'yell', 'the theatre', 'half', 'the movie'], ['a perfect movie', 'a lot', 'sense', 'brain', 'Endgame', 'a movie'], ['the whole trilogy', 'the theatre', 'no doubt'], ['a fan', 'love', 'joy']]","[['movie', 'theatre', 'out'], ['movie', 'expectations', 'first half', 'film', 'anything'], ['fight scene', 'trailer', 'fight scene'], ['course', 'fight scenes'], ['bit', 'funny lines'], ['plot', 'character', 'opinion and lead', 'events', 'film', 'plots and entrances', 'beginning', 'second half', 'second half', 'movie'], ['VFX', 'film'], ['action sequence', 'tons of details'], ['visuals', 'insaaane'], ['couple of Spidy suits', 'anything'], [], ['times', 'hero cause Benedict', 'great actor'], ['Zendaya role', 'Spidy', 'GF'], ['Finale', 'film', 'feels', 'dream come', 'fans', 'world', 'emotions'], ['post credit scenes', 'everyone yell', 'theatre', 'half', 'movie'], ['perfect movie', 'lot of things', 'sense', 'brain', 'questions like Endgame', 'movie'], ['whole trilogy', 'theatre', 'doubt'], ['fan', 'love and joy']]"

61,Spider-Man: No Way Home,The best live action Spider-Man film ever made and probably ever will be made for that matter,"""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" is the third solo Spider-Man movie to be set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Tom Holland once again in the lead role, it goes without saying that this is the best live action Spider-Man film ever made and probably ever will be made for that matter.In the events after ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"", the secret identity of Peter Parker (Tom Holland) as Spider-Man has been exposed to the entire world after his fight with Quentin Beck/Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal). No longer being able to take the onslaught of media and public backlash, Peter seeks help from Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to cast a spell to make everyone forget he is Spider-Man. However, during the casting of the spell, Peter accidentally causes things to go wrong, fracturing the multiverse and leading to the emergence of many villains from realities unfamiliar to this one.Aside from Batman, the superhero that has left the most impact on me personally is Spider-Man. In fact, the very first superhero film I ever saw at the cinema was the 2002 Sam Raimi-directed ""Spider-Man"" starring Tobey Maguire. I'd probably go as far to say it is that film I credit with helping to kick-start my fondness for the genre as a whole, paving the way for many others like it. With ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" acknowledging not only the original Raimi films but the Marc Webb-directed, Andrew Garfield-led ""Amazing Spider-Man"" films as well, there was bound to be a lot of speculation surrounding whether or not it could live up to all this hype. In short, the answer is a resounding yes.Not since ""Avengers: Endgame"" has a Marvel superhero film affected me on such an emotional level and not since the 2008 ""Iron Man"" film has a solo hero story left this much of an impact. Of course, to discuss my favourite parts would give away vital spoilers so I won't go into too much detail here. I absolutely love the amount of respect paid to each of these series of films. Even the divisive ""Amazing Spider-Man"" films, which I actually liked despite their flaws, are treated with just as much love and affection as their Raimi/MCU counterparts. Moments like these go beyond simple fanservice and are clearly there as a thank you to everyone who have stuck with this iconic hero for almost twenty years now. They certainly put a big smile on the face of this responsible 30-something adult.The concept of the multiverse was first teased back in ""Avengers: Endgame"" and further elaborated on in the Disney+ series ""Loki"". However, for the most part, those ventures had a proper sense of management preventing things from spiralling out of control. Here, everything feels like fair game. The stakes are at an all time high as these villains pour out from their respective universes to seek vengeance on their particular Peter Parker, not knowing that they won't find him here at all. Anyone who knows me will remember that I love stories that involve alternate realities and history, so to see something like this combined with a film about one of my favourite superheroes was nothing short of wonderful. This film keeps you on your toes as you anticipate who Spider-Man will fight next. Again, I won't reveal which of the villain fights excited me the most due to spoilers so all I will say is that each of them had at least one moment that made the young kid inside me very happy.Tom Holland has come a long way since we first saw him don the Spider-Man suit back in ""Captain America: Civil War"". His high-spirited youthfulness has not waned over the past five years since he still has that uncanny ability to entertain us with his unique take on the beloved hero. That's not to say he is only capable of light-hearted fun, as here we see him demonstrate some of his darkest acting to date. This film definitely isn't afraid to hit us hard in the feels at the most appropriate times, frequently delving deep into Peter Parker's emotional state at such an important point in his life.Additionally, I have finally come to accept Zendaya's performance as MJ. It has taken me three films but her version of the character has finally grown on me. Originally, I found her pessimistic attitude and willingness to bring the mood down highly annoying but she has now matured into a vital ally of Peter that I enjoy seeing on screen. Naturally, her chemistry with Holland feels genuine, considering the two actors are actually dating in real life with their romantic scenes adding that much needed heart to the film.I won't speak at length about any specific villain as that will give away major spoilers so all I will say is that seeing each of them again in one place was quite overwhelming, but this time in a good way. It's both amusing and surprising to see Raimi-era villains interact with Webb-era villains who are equally as confused as to why they have been transported into this universe. Something that certain Spider-Man films have come under fire for is their cramming of too many villains into one movie, leaving the story cluttered and incomprehensible. This time around, it actually works to the film's advantage since the idea of there being multiple universes following a different timeline has already been properly established. Something like this leaves things open for other multiverse-related oddities happening in future MCU projects, which excites me greatly.Since the film has set the bar so high, I can't help but wonder how the MCU will ever be able to top it. Like ""Avengers: Endgame"" before it, ""No Way Home"" should be treated as something of a watershed moment in the entire MCU. It succeeds in entertaining both longtime fans of the Spider-Man character who have been watching him for nearly twenty years while simultaneously serving the purpose as a great continuation of the ever-expanding MCU storyline. With that said, I think all fans of Spider-Man owe it to themselves to see this film as soon as possible.

The whole studio was screaming from the beginning until end of the movie, this movie was so perfect, Epic, Awesome and I can't even describe it. When Andrew was there I was screaming and that was making me shaking until now the visual, edit, it so so so good than the other MCU movie this year except Eternals cause they visual look great like a game. I still can't believe it's look like what fans theory said and fan made I can't.I really enjoyed the movie the credit scenes and everything in this movie, and it was so prefect. When Andrew was saved MJ I was really shocked, shacking, that's was epic, and everybody was like screaming exiting applause and me to HAHAHA. After I watch Spiderman I was really wanna cry cause it was so good. I can't stop telling you guys this movie was super good 100/10, 10/10 I really wanna watch it again.

Ned mastering the Doctor Strange Ring instantly (0 training)
2. Peter's decision to steal the cube from doctor strange because he wanted to ""cure"" a few villains and consequently risk his universe

68,Spider-Man: No Way Home,A Cash Grab for a Willing Marvel Fan,"It would be unfair to say that I never really laud as great films BUT I always admire this ability to create quality escapism.With all that, I think Spider-Man: No Way Home might be the first film of that series that I actually hate .Firstly, this film feels so juvenile to the point that it is annoying. I guess this is a film not really made for me. I found the way Hollands tries to plays up the good boy persona exceedingly off-putting AND not needed. Zendaya and the Filipino guy are just a figment on its story. They even tried to gentrify the ""other"" versions of Spiderman film. Funnily, I love all the treatment for the Original Spiderman characters. Otherwise, its a mixed bag.Secondly, I found the cause of conflict in the film so unnecessary. It does not make sense for me why and how it happened. It feels like watching a cash grab for fans.I mean the conflict of the film is that his presence as a superhero has such a negative effects to their live that they were ultimately banned to their collegiate school BUT it is contrast with a rally showing their popularity too. It is like be consistent film. Even the spell is hinged on the fact that they did not plan. They go on as if this is a thing he does every time BUT he just goes for it without really thinking through of the whatnots. Ultimately, the choice of Holland Peter to armchair psychologist ughh. Just watch it, its like a Bob the Builder-esque plot line.Ultimately, what really sour me about the film is the Dr Strange Conundrum. Why even watch when the consequences can be reversed and played on? I mean, he did had some in the end BUT is it really not deserved. As a viewer, I hate it from since the Avenger films BUT I hate it more so this time, because it actively says it can AND it can even personalize it.Overall, this is a pure cash grab for people who are watching it for the characters but not the content.

70,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Emotionally incoherent but chunks are good,"No Way Home starts with as much silliness as any Spider-Man movie in history. Peter Parker, unmasked, asks Doctor Strange to make everyone forget him, then hedges, then everything gets weird as a bunch of bad guys from previous Spider-Man movie series start wreaking havoc.The multiverse is, of course, a major component of Into the Spider-verse, but while that was brilliant and cool, here it comes across as profoundly silly.So in my head I was seeing this as the silliest of all Spider-man movies; a ludicrous romp with fun mindless action. And then, in a weird tonal shift, the movie gets really dark, and then tries to go back to the light-hearted bit with that hanging over it, and does some more really silly stuff, and some rather confused but fast-paced action, and then goes for a sad thing that I found kinda boring, and, well, what is this supposed to *be*.It doesn't make much sense, it's tonally chaotic, and as with the previous film, the action is fleetfully enjoyable but entirely forgettable.Still, a reasonable amount of the humor works, it's fun to see the way they play with the multiverse, and there's definitely fun to be had.

72,Spider-Man: No Way Home,"The best Spider-Man movie, of all time!","Spider-Man: No Way Home takes place immediately after the events of Spider-Man: Far From Home(2019).

However, the spell goes awry & villains from the multiverse show up. Now, Peter will find out what it truly means to be Spider-Man.Spider-Man: No Way Home is an awe-inspiring film. Director Jon Watts has perfectly completed his Spider-Man trilogy. The action set pieces are jaw-dropping. The visual effects are fantastic. The 3D is eye-popping, especially in IMAX. The humor & the emotional scenes are on point, just like every other Spidey movie. You will cry, laugh and cheer till your voice gets hoarse. Tom Holland is spectacular as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Tom Holland further solidifies that his portrayal of the iconic superhero, is the best. Zendaya is outstanding as MJ. Holland & Zendaya share electrifying chemistry, in all their scenes together. Jacob Batalon is superb as Ned Leeds. Jamie Foxx is brilliant as Max Dillon/Electro. Willem Dafoe is phenomenal as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. Dafoe proves yet again, why he's the best Spider-Man villain in the entire franchise. Alfred Molina is excellent as Otto Octavius/Doctor Octopus. Thomas Haden Church is great as Flint Marko/Sandman. Rhys Ifans is impressive as Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard. The supporting cast is unforgettable. Spider-Man: No Way Home is a must watch for die-hard and casual Spider-Man fans.

76,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Lacking in story. Good in action.,So for me to really love a movie i have to love everything about it and not just pieces of it. And there was basically no story here. The story of the whole movie is Spiderman asks dr strange to make the world forget him. And the rest of the movie is about the villains that show up basically just joking around having fun and trying to kill Spiderman. Reacting to the story without really adding anything to it.The rest of the movie has a lot of plot holes. A whole Lot. Like for the movie to happen Spiderman has to suddenly think he can cure mental illness. And To suddenly realize that the giant lizard man was left behind in the van. Maybe we was going to go to the 7-11 and bring back a mountain dew. Who know what they were thinking.

77,Spider-Man: No Way Home,I'm Sure It's Fun for Die Hard Fans,"""Spider-Man"" fans are going to have a total nerdgasm over this movie. Those of us who haven't seen all the Spider-Man movies and aren't knowledgeable about the Marvel universe may have a good time but also might be left wondering what all the hoopla is about.I only saw the first two Tobey Maguire Spider-Mans and didn't see any of the Andrew Garfield ones, but Tom Holland is definitely my favorite actor to play him. This movie is too bogged down by exposition and has a saggy middle section that tries for heart-tugging drama -- why, why do these junk food movies try to be more serious than they should? -- but I will admit that the ending gave me the feels. I'm not really chomping at the bit to see where this story goes next, but it was fun enough seeing this movie with my 10 year old son.Grade: B.","[['a total nerdgasm', 'this movie'], ['Marvel', 'universe', 'a good time', 'the hoopla', 'Tobey Maguire', 'Andrew Garfield', 'Tom Holland', 'favorite actor'], ['This movie', 'exposition', 'a saggy middle section', 'heart-tugging drama', 'these junk', 'food'], [], ['the bit', 'this story', 'this movie', 'year', 'old son.Grade', 'B']]","[['fans', 'total nerdgasm', 'movie'], ['Spider-Man movies', 'Marvel universe', 'good time', 'hoopla', 'Tobey Maguire Spider-Mans', 'Andrew Garfield ones', 'Tom Holland', 'favorite actor'], ['movie', 'exposition', 'saggy middle section', 'heart-tugging drama', 'junk food movies'], ['feels'], ['bit', 'story', 'movie', 'year', 'old son.Grade', 'B']]"
78,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Your Senses Gonna Blow So Hard!,"It's...I'm still trying to realize what I've seen, but I've seen things I didn't think I'd ever see on the big screen! We all know that spoilers have been on the internet for more than a year, but apart from the things we thought, there are a lot of other things and of course I won't spoil anything, but...the film pulls very thin string from our emotions and it worked perfectly!The story is solid, it's not just fan service, which was one of my fears, there are explanations for everything. Holland grows in front our eyes with this role and this is one of the many pleasant aspects of the film. Strange's role is important (not a big shock).The villains are...I felt like a kid watching Spider-Man: The Animated Series again...I don't even know where to start. The film has more than a big stake and in some places you stand on the edge of your seat.The action scenes are the best I've ever seen in a Spidey movie and are generally among the best in comicbook movies! There are so many well-coordinated scenes, that after the movie you will want to watch them again and again.There are a lot of dialogues that hit the emotions really hard and that will be quoted long after the movie. In some places you even want the villains to prevail, because it looks so good and you want more and more and more...There are comedic moments of course, most of which well placed, but compared to the previous two films, this one is much darker and more serious. Like I said, Spidey is growing up, and that's tangible. There are a lot of surprises, some smaller, others bigger, but the movie certainly deserves more than one watch with friends. The hall was exploding! (Endgame vibes).Michael Giacchino's music, as always, is remarkable. The classic Spidey soundtrack mixed with some darker elements is a delight for the ears.Open your eyes on four, because there are a lot of references, some more tangible than others, but hardcore fans will be more than happy with what they saw.Knowing that this movie leads straight to Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness...you better prepare for the unexpected!","[['the big screen'], ['the internet', 'a year', 'a lot', 'course', 'anything', 'the film', 'thin string', 'The story', 'fan', 'service', 'everything'], ['Holland', 'this role', 'the film'], ['Strange', 'role', 'a big shock', '.The', 'a kid', 'Animated Series'], ['The film', 'a big stake', 'the edge', 'seat.The action', 'Spidey', 'movie', 'comicbook'], ['the movie', 'a lot', 'the movie'], ['course', 'much darker'], ['Spidey'], ['a lot', 'the movie', 'watch'], ['The hall'], ['Endgame', 'Giacchino', 'music'], ['Spidey', 'soundtrack', 'mixed', 'some darker', 'a delight', 'a lot', 'this movie', 'Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse', 'Madness', 'prepare']]","[['things', 'big screen'], ['spoilers', 'internet', 'year', 'things', 'lot', 'other things', 'course', 'anything', 'film', 'thin string', 'emotions', 'story', 'fan service', 'fears', 'explanations for everything'], ['Holland', 'eyes', 'role', 'many pleasant aspects', 'film'], ['Strange', 'role', 'big shock', '.The villains', 'kid', 'Animated Series'], ['film', 'big stake', 'places', 'edge', 'action scenes', 'Spidey movie', 'comicbook movies'], ['many well-coordinated scenes', 'movie', 'lot of dialogues', 'emotions', 'movie'], ['places', 'villains', 'moments of course', 'films', 'much darker'], ['Spidey'], ['lot of surprises', 'others', 'movie', 'watch with friends'], ['hall'], ['Endgame', 'Giacchino', 'music'], ['Spidey soundtrack mixed', 'darker elements', 'delight', 'eyes', 'lot of references', 'others', 'fans', 'movie', 'Doctor Strange', 'Multiverse of Madness', 'prepare']]"
79,Spider-Man: No Way Home,A Spider CU's Messy Fan Feast.,"Aside from the rushed ""pre-paid"" 10s and 9s, the quality of the film should not mainly be based on the stunning visuals but also on the plot, screenplay and acting skills which clearly fails to hold itself together.Starting with the ""Only in Theaters"" bs, which I feel is quite outdated, pretty much like the suits behind the industry itself, to ancient that they don't know we are living in the digital era as the new way of life! Why force people to either free stream or the typical silliness of the theater experience, being stuck among people talking, phones peeping, bad seats, extremely loud sound, unable to pause or rewind...etc.Not to mention the contagious threat when you can enjoy your experience wherever you wish digitally! The only reason I see it is for the rich company to get more rich. The option for digitally streaming and theaters should be available from day 1.About the movie itself...Playing on being a Spidey's CU fan fest with the multiverse concept the film can hold itself for being interesting yet it can't hide the fact that the plot is forced and the directing is average with lots of moderate fighting scenes.Silly as it may sound but if you only saw any trailer you practically have seen most of the film by now. The plot is messy and forced and the screenplay feels inconsistent and awkward at points, mainly to force lead the plot into the multiverse situation, don't get me wrong, I do respect the homage and as a matter of fact most of my rating is based on it but my eyes never glow whenever I see a rendered 3D scene like most, the human factor play a lot in my count.","[['the quality', 'the film', 'the plot', 'screenplay', 'Theaters', 'bs', 'the industry', 'the digital era', 'the new way', 'life'], ['force', 'either free stream', 'the typical silliness', 'the theater', 'experience', 'loud sound', 'etc.Not', 'the contagious threat', 'experience', 'wherever'], ['The only reason', 'the rich company'], ['The option', 'day', 'the movie', 'Spidey', 'CU', 'fan', 'fest', 'the multiverse', 'the film', 'the fact', 'the plot', 'the directing', 'any trailer', 'the film'], ['The plot', 'the screenplay', 'the plot', 'the multiverse situation', 'the homage', 'a matter', 'fact', 'rating', 'scene', 'the human factor', 'a lot', 'count']]","[['quality', 'film', 'stunning visuals', 'plot', 'screenplay', 'skills', 'Theaters', 'bs', 'suits', 'industry', 'digital era', 'way of life'], ['force people', 'free stream', 'typical silliness', 'theater experience', 'people', 'phones', 'bad seats', 'loud sound', 'etc.Not', 'contagious threat', 'experience wherever'], ['only reason', 'rich company'], ['option', 'theaters', 'day', 'movie', 'Spidey', 'CU fan fest', 'multiverse', 'film', 'fact', 'plot', 'directing', 'lots', 'trailer', 'film'], ['plot', 'screenplay', 'points', 'plot', 'multiverse situation', 'homage', 'matter of fact', 'rating', 'eyes', 'scene', 'human factor', 'lot', 'count']]"

81,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Trying to do better.,"Tobey Maguire's trilogy remains indelible, from its origin story, the pitch-perfect sequel, and the messy conclusion. It has Raimi written all over it, and even at its worst moments, the least you could dub it is memorable. The follow-up series doesn't have that same appeal, but Garfield's charisma shines through, as it similarly does here. Conversely, Holland's rendition has always felt a little cut-and-paste from its surrounding universe, unable to separate itself from the whimsy and bathos of the MCU. This Peter Parker's one-liners are drawn from the same snarky persona as Iron Man, Star-Lord, War Machine, Doctor Strange, Ant-Man...the list goes on. I've made my peace with it. It isn't a new criticism, and could be levelled at most films post-Phase One. But it's always felt limiting in terms of crafting distinct character (and filmic) voices and undermining attempts at sentimentality. Let's start with Cumberbatch's Strange. He's stepping into the mentor role post-Endgame but he's never been given a meaningful opportunity to develop his own philosophy on the character, let alone a voice. Sans his solo film, the premise of the Sorcerer Supreme makes him a convenient plot device to facilitate the adventures of other superheroes. Listen to his dialogue here; it's always delivered at a distance, drenched in cynicism, as if it's afraid of fully buying into the idea of a connection. Cumberbatch seems to be constantly setting up the next punchline, and so even if this abrasive back-and-forth elicits laughs, it never builds to anything genuine, rendering the climatic callback (obvious from a mile away) into a deflated attempt at growth and recognition. Yes, RDJ addressed Holland in the same way, but there was history and a relationship there. There's an inherent self-consciousness to the way that Feige and co. Craft the MCU's humour, so relentlessly wary of losing the audience for more than a second that they keep sincerity at an arm's length. Observe how the entire film just grinds to a halt for the Spidey's stand-up routine atop the Statue of Liberty scaffolding; the trialogue isn't written for the characters, it's written for the fans to play spot the reference (""You're amazing. I want to hear you say it.""). Marvel would never in a million years allow their Spider-Man to be the butt of the joke, or freeze-frame on his goofy smile over 'Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head'. He's too cool for that.This universe's Peter Parker and his defining Spider-Man moment is how he reacts to losing his Uncle Ben, but the crux of its emotional impact rests on what has already been established. What do we really know about this version of Aunt May, anyway? No, not what we surmise and assume based on the previous actions of the mentor archetype, but her as an actual person. How much screentime has Tomei been afforded here and in the first two films that isn't delegated to punchlines about her hotness or her apparent fling with Happy? You need to earn the right to drop that iconic line about responsibility; the words don't hold any weight in and of themselves. What does follow her death works in pushing Peter into newer and darker territory for this Spider-Man, and Holland is finally asked to consider the interiority of his character and how these circumstances might actually damage the psyche of a teenager. After all, what was the complication of Far From Home beyond mopping up the external mess of an Avengers-level threat? Here, Peter must contend with the consequences of his actions (the film initially made me balk at the idea of resetting the universe just so a few teens could get accepted into their college of choice, and then cleverly flips that on its head) and ultimately assume the burden and emotional baggage that comes with being a superhero. The rooftop scene where Maguire and Garfield confess of their own failures and futile quests for vengeance is unlike anything even the MCU is capable of; it's not merely a crossover, but a character speaking across generations to itself, pleading for this Peter to avoid repeating their past mistakes. It leans pretty hard on the audience having that pre-knowledge; you need to know the stories they refer to in order to buy into the emotion, but for those who do, it's genuinely affecting.So Peter completes his mission and manages to do justice to Aunt May's final wish, but what of the 'villains'? The other core theme of the film, beyond Peter's grappling with his grief and the value of revenge, is the idea of second chances being afforded to those who deserve them (who, in Aunt May's world, is everyone). Yet how much of this actually rings true for each member of the Spidey rogues gallery dragged in from the multiverse? Norman and Otto are afforded the most agency as a result of their characters' redemption being more or less pre-ordained. They don't need 'fixing', just a removal of that corruptive influence and a reversion to their original selves. But what of the others? Electro is stripped of his powers and therefore his bloodlust, makes a brief quip referencing Miles Morales, and then is returned to live life as his pre-superpowered, nerdy outcast self. What lesson does he learn? Sandman, as one of the relatively more sympathetic villains of the Spideyverse, was already redeemed at the end of his chapter and never even died at the hands of Spider-Man, so his appearance here is puzzling, reduced once more to an angry CGI spectacle that hits things (Thomas Haden Church receives all of 20 seconds of screentime, with the rest of his stay in sand form). Peter may take responsibility for mistakes made and change himself for good, but how much of this change transfers over to those he impacted? It's a little too neat of a thematic bow to tie all these different arcs together in the name of redemption. The action itself is fine, inoffensive; the climactic battle starts off poorly for the Spideys, before Holland gives a pep talk about teamwork and they then execute a series of pre-planned, carefully choreographed moves in front of a blue screen, only this time it works! There's nothing actually revealed about leadership or teamwork here, but we don't care; we just want that master shot of their superhero landings. It's screensaver material.Legacy is key here: that of this live-action universe across three generations of the webslinger, of the characters within their worlds, and of the films themselves. It's now nigh impossible to engage with this franchise without consuming each and every chapter of its storytelling, an increasingly mammoth task that grows with each phase, miniseries, and cinematic event. You can't just view them as one-offs; you need to buy in and subscribe and devote time to tracking and keeping tabs on its chronology. Your reward is the payoff for this dedication; you know that character, you know the event that they are referencing when it comes up on the big screen. Garfield's Peter is forced to relive the same moment that led to Gwen's death during his rescue of MJ, and fans can recognise the trauma it induces and how significant and moving it is for him to be able to save her this time round. Other fans, however, from the looks of internet reaction videos, seem to be cheering in recognition of this. Is that not emblematic of the two camps of MCU takes in conflict with each other? I'm unsure whether they can or should be conflated. In 2012, when the MCU was still in its infancy, Ebert wrote this of The Avengers: ""It provides its fans with exactly what they desire. Whether it is exactly what they deserve is arguable."" I think we do deserve these films. We've supported the franchise from its early rocky beginnings, and we've been there every step of the way in its evolution into a cultural giant. I experienced my own payoff, as millions around the world did, seeing Avengers Endgame almost a decade later as each character stepped out of their portals, the goosebumps on my arm as close to something quantifiable for that feeling of awe and yes, recognition. What lies in future for this franchise, and what is (if there are any plans for, commercial or otherwise) its endgame? I didn't feel anything of that calibre watching No Way Home, but I think it still sticks its landing. Having sacrificed his own relationships to fix the mess that emerged from his faults, Holland returns to where I think Peter Parker truly belongs: in a run-down apartment, landlord berating him for the rent, once again alone with only his suit for company. But there's a reason why the most important scenes are always shot with the mask off. This is where the core and heart of the character resides, and what Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Verse understood so well: the power was never a choice, but accepting the responsibility that comes with it is. Holland's Peter finally makes that choice, and in doing so unveils the human behind the mythos of the superhero. No nanotech or Instant-Kill Mode could ever make up for that.","[['Tobey Maguire', 'trilogy', 'origin', 'story', 'the pitch-perfect sequel', 'the messy conclusion'], [], ['The follow-up series', 'that

84,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Everything I wanted and more,"Wow what a ride and such an experience. As a big Spider-Man fan I got a surprising few things from this movie too. First of all they stuck with the villains stories no matter the reception they got on the previous films they stuck with it and that's honestly so respectful. To see not all of them actually be villains because Peter is trying to help them from themselves by not dying was the Spider-Man I have been hoping to see from Tom Holland which I didn't feel in the other movies. Green Goblin is easily the most terrifying how he pretends to be on Peters side and tries to manipulate Peter and May. Lizard wasn't in it much but hey he was still good in the movie. Sandman was awesome, he protected Peter from Electro after the events of Spider-Man 3 and just wanted to be with his daughter. Electro was fun and fresh too with his new look and the visuals. Doc Ock obviously amazing and to hear the call backs to Spider-Man 2, so happy they didn't make him a villain and he actually helped them. Second of all Aunt May being Peters ""Uncle Ben"" was amazing, she delivered the line perfectly and she was just great especially since we had more screen time with her in these movies than we did with Ben in the others. Thirdly Matt Murdock! Are you kidding me! A very small part but wow it's good to see him again looking great and I can't wait to see what they do with that character. Fourthly Andrew and Tobey of course... Andrew coming through that portal and being not quite sure if it was him until he came forward was unreal everyone went mad in the cinema (Same with Tobey) he is still great after years, Tobey amazing too they just hold a special place in a lot of peoples hearts and their interactions with the characters especially Peter (Toms) Just very impactful and maybe they will come back who knows. 5th point is that in the portal coming through we saw Kraven and a Rhino variant and I wanted them to come but who knows... overall they ended the film great with the villains not having to die. Final points I'll say is that Green Goblin vs Peter was pretty brutal, it was intense and Tobey stopping Peter from killing him was just so perfect. My last final point is that ending... Peter having to leave everything behind to keep them safe was the Spider-Man we all know and love. Him getting an apartment struggling to get by and being Spider-Man still with a comic accurate suit and not an iron spider suit. This is the Spider-Man I have wanted and I can't wait to see what they will do. The ending made me think of the game for the PS4/5 and if they go down that route of tone and stuff then this could be some of the best Spider-Man movies coming up. No gadgets, just Spider-Man and Peter Parker being their natural selves and the heroes we all love. Overall this film is something else and I'm glad I was there to see it, it's a good laugh, it's a good thrill and it's Spider-Man.

85,Spider-Man: No Way Home,"If I had to describe this film in one word, that word would be: Magic","It has some minor flaws here and there- but Spider-Man No Way Home is easily the best Spider-Man film to date- successfully capturing the energy and spirit of the franchises past with an entirely new direction. One of the few things I noticed while watching this film is how intimate it was with the audience. More than ever we begin to see things from Peter's point of view, and it sculpts a very touching and emotional narrative that is easily the best execution in a Marvel property in a while. While there are some small things I think they could have touched up a bit better, this film was massively entertaining, incredibly funny, and surprisingly very emotional in the best way possible. It blends the past characters so well into its story you hardly feel it's their first time in the universe. Even more, it's such a unique experience to finally see 3 generations of superhero fans unite for such an epic opportunity- of which seems more than well done- almost too good to be true at times. It may not be perfect, but personally- I loved nearly every minute of it, and can't wait to see what this franchise continues to offer down the road.My Rating: 9.5/10.","[['Way Home', 'Spider-Man film', 'the energy', 'spirit', 'new direction'], ['this film', 'the audience'], ['Peter', 'point', 'view', 'emotional narrative', 'execution', 'Marvel', 'property', 'a while'], ['a bit', 'this film', 'way'], ['story', 'first time', 'the universe'], ['a unique experience', 'superhero', 'an epic opportunity-'], ['every minute', 'this franchise', 'the road.My', 'Rating']]","[['minor flaws', 'Way Home', 'Spider-Man film', 'energy and spirit', 'franchises', 'new direction'], ['few things', 'film', 'audience'], ['things from Peter', 'point of view', 'emotional narrative', 'execution', 'Marvel property', 'while'], ['small things', 'bit', 'film', 'way'], ['past characters', 'story', 'first time', 'universe'], ['unique experience', 'generations of superhero fans', 'epic opportunity-', 'times'], ['minute', 'franchise', 'road.My Rating']]"
86,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Spectacular and amazing but not a complete homerun,"Updated with spoilers:
This is the spider-man movie to see. This is the love child of the entire MCU. The action is fantastic, everything is great, and there is so many brilliant callbacks and wonderful nostalgia mixed with love, emotions and great acting. For the first 40min or so this is one of the best superhero movies ever made, with Daredevil cameo as the top of the line - and I loved this move, however it has a few errors that lower the score and the longer the movie goes the less I enjoyed it which is kinda strange since the ending is spectacular and Amazing.The CGI is not always on point. Those computer graphic misses stod out was because it is excellent otherwise, so kinda weird with a few misses. I think the Sandman was badly done and The Lizard was a joke. I also seriously dislike Peter decision to try to save everyone and the fight with Strange. That is where the movie almost lost me. And these are clearly evil people, and they died in their respective universe. But okay, the plot does need to happen... The worst thing though is why them? In all the universes, of all the people that know who Peter is, these are the ones coming through? Why not 97 of Uncle Ben's? That would make more sense. My final complaint is that all that comes before comes to Peter is now erased, which is fine and a great hero sacrifice, but it also create issues with continuity and storylines.The great awesomeness is all the rest. The music score is amazing, best since Captain Marvel (which, no matter what you thought of that movie, has the best original score of any superhero movie). And the Flashpoint? Haha.. great stuff. The action is spectacular, the script amazing, all the actors do an fantastic job with Willem Dafoe probably stealing the acting crown. Two end-credit scenes, although I heard some saw a long ""trailer"", which I did not see so felt that was kinda weird, perhaps only in some theatres? The first meh, kinda cool I guess. The second about something I care nothing about with a character I care absolutely nothing about so kinda disappointing to me. I am not going to see Dr Strange II, I really dislike Wanda and I dislike Elizabeth Olsen portrait of her even less. That TV show was the worst I have ever seen, except for Batwoman.. nothing is worse than Batwoman... That Strange movie will suck.Despite my criticism this movie is together with the current running Hawkeye show (which is fantastic) I feel like the MCU is still alive and kicking. And with Daredevil and Kingpin now part of the MCU, can be worse for sure. This movie really take hold of you and give you that magic which the best superhero movies do. I would rank this as the second best Spider-Man movie and top 10 for sure within the MCU. 8/10 and I highly recommend.","[['the spider-man movie'], ['the love', 'child', 'MCU'], ['The action', 'everything', 'love', 'great acting'], ['superhero', 'Daredevil', 'cameo', 'the top', 'the line', 'this move', 'the score', 'the movie', 'Amazing.The CGI', 'point'], ['Those computer', 'kinda weird'], ['Sandman', 'Lizard', 'a joke'], ['Peter', 'decision', 'everyone', 'the fight', 'Strange'], ['the movie'], ['respective universe'], ['the plot'], ['thing', 'though'], ['Peter'], ['Uncle Ben'], ['sense'], ['final complaint', 'Peter', 'a great hero', 'sacrifice', 'continuity', 'storylines.The great awesomeness', 'the rest'], ['The music', 'score', 'Captain Marvel', 'no matter', 'that movie', 'original score', 'any superhero movie'], ['Flashpoint'], ['Haha ..', 'great stuff'], ['The action', 'the script', 'amazing', 'an fantastic job', 'Willem Dafoe', 'crown'], ['trailer', 'kinda weird'], ['The first meh', 'cool'], ['something', 'nothing', 'a character', 'nothing', 'kinda disappointing'], ['Dr Strange II', 'Wanda', 'Elizabeth Olsen', 'portrait'], ['That TV', 'show', 'Batwoman ..', 'nothing', 'Batwoman', 'Strange', 'movie', 'criticism', 'this movie', 'the current running', 'Hawkeye', 'show', 'MCU', 'kicking'], ['Daredevil', 'Kingpin', 'part', 'MCU'], ['This movie', 'hold', 'magic', 'superhero'], ['Spider-Man movie', 'MCU'], []]","[['spoilers', 'spider-man movie'], ['love child', 'entire MCU'], ['action', 'everything', 'many brilliant callbacks', 'wonderful nostalgia', 'love', 'emotions', 'great acting'], ['superhero movies', 'Daredevil cameo', 'top', 'line', 'move', 'few errors', 'score', 'movie', 'Amazing.The CGI', 'point'], ['computer', 'graphic misses', 'kinda weird', 'few misses'], ['Sandman', 'Lizard', 'joke'], ['Peter decision', 'everyone', 'fight with Strange'], ['movie'], ['evil people', 'respective universe'], ['plot'], ['thing though'], ['universes', 'people', 'Peter', 'ones'], ['Uncle Ben'], ['sense'], ['final complaint', 'Peter', 'hero sacrifice', 'issues with continuity', 'storylines.The great awesomeness', 'rest'], ['music score', 'Captain Marvel', 'matter', 'movie', 'original score', 'superhero movie'], ['Flashpoint'], ['Haha ..', 'great stuff'], ['action', 'script amazing', 'actors', 'job with Willem Dafoe', 'crown'], ['end-credit scenes', 'trailer', 'kinda weird', 'theatres'], ['first meh', 'cool'], ['something', 'nothing', 'character', 'nothing', 'kinda disappointing'], ['Dr Strange II', 'Wanda', 'Elizabeth Olsen portrait'], ['TV show', 'Batwoman .. nothing', 'Batwoman', 'Strange movie', 'criticism', 'movie', 'running Hawkeye show', 'MCU', 'kicking'], ['Daredevil and Kingpin', 'part', 'MCU'], ['movie', 'hold', 'magic', 'superhero movies'], ['Spider-Man movie', 'MCU'], []]"
87,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Spectacular.,"Where to begin? I would find it extremely difficult for any Spider-Man fan to dislike this film. What's amazing is the feat that Jon Watts, Kevin Feige, Amy Pascal and others accomplished here.Let me just say the the plot has a lot of mumbo jumbo, comic-book logic that typically most comic fans can get on board with including myself, but because the MCU has built enough trust with everyone, you just kinda go with it. Even if you don't, the magic of all these actors and legacy characters returning for this dazzling spectacle will kinda make you forgive it.Lets also just get this out of the way. It was the worst kept secret that Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield were appearing alongside Tom Holland. The consensus on this was pretty much acknowledged to almost every fanboy, fangirl and most casual fans too. Also the return of Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin, Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus, Jamie Foxx's Electro, Thomas Haden Church's Sandman and Rhys Ifans' Lizard made it more apparent. It's just a marvel(pun intended) that Sony and Marvel/Disney were able to bring everyone back. Never would I have thought it was possible.The villains are a lot more poignant and prominent than I thought they would be. Alfred Molina and Willem Dafoe are THE MVPs of the bunch. Dafoe is used to great effect and is as menacing as I remember him and Molina commands the screen with his presence and delivery. They still feel very much in tune with what Sam Raimi did. Jamie Foxx has a second chance with Electro and it works a lot more now than it did since the last time we saw him in 2014. Unfortunately Thomas Haden Church and Rhys Ifans are the benchwarmers of the villains. BUT, used to some capacity where they don't feel totally left out.Now lets talk about the Spider-Men.TOM HOLLAND: I think Marvel Studios and Sony either had this planned all along or they heard the fans and listened. What I loved about Holland/MCU's iteration is that he is kid who brings his exciting energy and youthful enthusiasm to the Avengers. Also as fan of Spidey comics, particularly the Ultimate Spider-Man series, I feel most of the best stories is when he's a teenager in high school. So I got what I wanted in that regard, however my criticism of his portrayal is that he was basically Iron Man Jr. With a lot of Stark tech. But here, they strip him down, beat him to a pulp, he loses his Aunt May, makes sacrifices and learns from his mistakes. He finally learns and understands with the help of Tobey and Andrew providing their wisdom. I think finally we are going to get the Spider-Man that we hoped he would grow into. It is Holland's best performance as the character by far.ANDREW GARFIELD: Jon Watts and his writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers redeem him. Not that his portrayal was bad, because personally I always found Garfield's Spider-Man the most accurate of the bunch and there are some things to like about the Marc Webb films. Garfield gets the closure he needed as his movies ended abruptly after the 2014 sequel. Every moment he has where he shares his experience with Holland and Maguire on screen is a major highlight. Especially when he talks about Gwen Stacy. He also has a nice moment where he saves Zendaya's MJ, mirroring the fact that he never got to save Gwen. Garfield absolutely crushed it and displayed his amazing acting chops.TOBEY MAGUIRE: For many, including myself Tobey Maguire is the OG. Growing up with his Spider-Man films, words can't really describe the emotions I felt seeing him back. I was practically reliving my childhood the minute he appeared. It was all coming back to me, being on the hype train during his era of films and just obsessing over the Sam Raimi films, it just brought me back. I truly felt like a kid again. Tobey's presence in the film feels very much like the older brother of the group and he bounces off Holland and Garfield seamlessly. It's been a hot minute seeing Tobey on the big screen since PAWN SACRIFICE(good movie by the way) and he hasn't lost a step.Once Garfield and Maguire appear, all three share the limelight as co-leads and not a single one of them feel left out.As for the rest of the cast. Benedict Cumberbatch always commands your attention. I was initially turned off of the idea of having Holland's Spidey have another mentor like figure, but here Strange and Spidey are at odds on how to handle their problem after the botched spell. So that was a nice surprise in the marketing and in the film. Marisa Tomei has way more to do in this film than the previous films and has an emotional send off with her death. Zendaya's MJ has grown on me since FAR FROM HOME and Jacob Batalon's Ned is less annoying here which I appreciated.Piggy backing off that, I did admire that Watts aimed for a more mature tone throughout the film. As I get older I do crave that serious tone a bit more and I savor it every time it is present. I mean yes the standard formulaic humor is still present, but I appreciated every moment where things got serious.I love the MCU and I'm always there to watch their product, but I can be honest and say that at times, they are like comfort food. I know what I'm getting and I know I'll enjoy it. I also haven't been shy of the films I've really disliked, but they have been consistent as a whole. However, when they either take big swings or assemble(pun intended) a film with a more mature tone, every so often we'll get absolute gems like the first IRON MAN, the CAPTAIN AMERICA trilogy, the first AVENGERS, the first GUARDIANS, and INFINITY WAR. I'm extremely pleased that SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME belongs with those gems. Should Sony and Marvel/Disney keep working together I look forward to more adventures as the Spider-Man I wanted Tom Holland to be. I would also be lying to you if I didn't crave more of Garfield and Maguire. Anything is possible nowadays as we even got a Charlie Cox's Daredevil cameo, which was also heavily speculated and if you've been keeping up with HAWKEYE, you know we're in for a treat.While the story can be cluttered, the film drives it home with the development of Holland's Spider-Man, some excellent performances, and fan service with a purpose. Definitely the best MCU Spider-Man film, one of my favorite MCU entries as a whole, and in the conversation of one of the best Spidey films with Raimi's SPIDER-MAN 2 and INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE.9.5/10.","[[], ['any Spider-Man fan', 'this film'], ['amazing', 'the feat', 'Jon Watts', 'Kevin Feige', 'Amy Pascal', 'the plot', 'a lot', 'comic-book logic', 'board', 'MCU', 'enough

89,Spider-Man: No Way Home,SPIDER-MAN 3...,"This film... it's going to be the topic of every conversation for the years to come.Obviously, we all kinda expected what was going to happen in this movie.Yet, we all wanted to see it with our own eyes.And it did happen:
THREE SPIDER-MAN'S! That were brought together in the same universe after Dr. Strange erroneously cast a dangerous spell.(We needed an excuse for this to happen, of course)
My personal review here:
I'll be honest, I never was much of a fan of Holland's Spider-Man. The reason I went to see this film was because my inner child needed to see with his own eyes, the possibility of Tobey and Andrew coming back.And, yes. I cried like a baby the moment I watched the Spider-Man from my childhood meeting the Spider-Man from my adolescence.This was VERY beautiful to watch.For a second I even sobbed.But then... something was left.It felt as if the writers did not know what to do with the three ""Spider-Men"" after putting them all together.After that huge moment, that made us all scream and clap, it didn't take long till the dialogue started to feel dumb, with fan service jokes or even about their own movies as Spider-Man.Like, ""yeah, you are the second one"".The moment I saw Tobey, Andrew and Tom together, I thought:
""Oh my god, this is going to be epic af""
""This will probably be the most important film of our generation"".But, by the end of the third act, I realized:
They did it again...
They took the characters we've loved since we were kids to put them in a millionaire project with a really bad script.Repeating Raimi's mistake. They put so many villains that they didn't know what to do with them, not even with three Spider-Man's.The movie started to feel rushed after that. Causing plot holes, lack of emotions or a good dialogue between each Spider-Man and the enemy from his own universe.(Tobey Maguire sees Norman Osborn ALIVE again and he doesn't say a word to him?)
(Tobey Maguire sees Otto Octavius ALIVE again and they only exchange two words as if they had seen each other at Home Depot)
They gave us a cheapie 20 minute fight where they must ""cure"" every single villain with a magical injection? With barely any good or lasting scenes from each Spider-Man.Not to mention the horrific way Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield just ""vanished"", going back to their respective universes.The movie only lasts two hours and a half. Would it have been so difficult to add 30 more minutes of the three Spider-Man's in action?We barely saw Maguire or Garfield fighting or do anything else before that terrible goodbye.And by the way, what happened to Tobey Maguire?

95,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Third Time's the Best Charm,"For the first time in nearly 20 years, I may have seen my favorite Spider-Man movie.And I'm not like a kid who loves the Ice Age movies and since part 17 is the newest one they've seen, it's their favorite. (Much like what they said about the 16 before it.) Nope. I sat from almost the first 10 minutes LOVING this movie and debating if this actually beat out the magnificent 2002's Spider-Man and its even better follow-up, 2004's Spider-Man 2.I will say this: This is my new 2nd favorite of ALL 27 MCU movies. Easy. And it's easily in the top three of the 10 theatrical-released Spider-Man movies. In fact, since part 2 in 2004, I have not been impressed with any of the Spider-Man movies until Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse and this third Tom Holland-led Spider-Man series.I barely liked Tom's Spider-Man: Homecoming and I refer to it Iron Man Jr because it was WAY more about Iron Man smarts and involvement and it clearly made Peter a complete moron who couldn't lift a finger or figure out anything on his own without big-daddy Tony helping. Tom's Spider-Man: Far From Home was better, but it still couldn't let go of Tony (EVEN after his character supposedly left the franchise.) This second rebooted version of Spider-Man of Tom Holland's made me sad, because of how dumb Peter is and how reliant he is on others, namely big-daddy Tony. This is NOT the brilliant Peter Parker I grew up with.But, FINALLY...they got it right with Tom's third movie. The trailer spoiled SO MUCH of this movie and the actors involved, as trailers are designed to be spoiler packed (usually the very last scene of the movie is in the trailer,) so I won't even go into the synopsis or what happens or who's in it. I just HIGHLY encourage you to see this ASAP and know: they FINALLY got Spider-Man right. After 5 disappointing follow-ups to Spider-Man 2, THEY FINALLY GOT SPIDER-MAN BACK ON TRACK.I laughed so hard, even though it wasn't like the traditional MCU movie where it's mostly a comedy. These were genuine jokes and not just inserted to please the audience who apparently wants more comedic MCU movies than action-packed Super-Hero movies. I cried a bit, even though it's mostly an uplifting movie. And yes, I marveled on how well acted and written this film is. Everybody gave it their 110% and no one stole scenes or out-performed anyone else. This was MY Endgame event.I loved this movie so much, I probably will buy it right away on Blu upon release. And to give you a hint of how much that is to me: I don't really buy Blurays anymore due to the convenience of streaming and of ALL 27 MCU movies, I only bought two so far. The rest, I can watch online if I feel like it. Most are forgettable, anyways.I heard they're building a new trilogy with Tom Holland continuing his role as Spidey. To be frank, before this viewing, I almost didn't want to see them. If this turned out just slightly better than Tom's 2nd one which was just slightly better than his mediocre 1st one, I was pretty much done.Now, my Spidey-Sense is tingling to see what they have in store for us next.","[['the first time', 'favorite Spider-Man movie.And', 'a kid', 'Ice Age', 'part', 'one'], [], ['Nope'], ['this movie', 'follow-up', 'favorite', 'ALL', 'MCU'], ['Easy'], [], ['fact', 'part', 'Spider-Man', 'Tom Holland-led Spider-Man', 'series.I', 'Tom', 'Spider-Man', 'Homecoming', 'Iron Man Jr', 'WAY', 'Iron Man', 'involvement', 'Peter', 'a complete moron', 'a finger', 'figure', 'anything', 'Tony'], ['Tom', 'Spider-Man', 'Far', 'Home', 'Tony', 'character', 'the franchise'], ['This second rebooted version', 'Spider-Man', 'Tom Holland', 'Peter', 'Tony'], ['NOT', 'Peter Parker', 'FINALLY', 'Tom', 'third movie'], ['The trailer', 'MUCH', 'this movie', 'last scene', 'the movie', 'the trailer', 'the synopsis'], ['HIGHLY', 'encourage', 'ASAP', 'Spider-Man right'], ['THEY FINALLY GOT SPIDER-MAN BACK ON TRACK.I', 'MCU', 'movie', 'a comedy'], ['the audience', 'MCU'], ['a bit', 'an uplifting movie'], ['this film'], ['Everybody', '%', 'no one', 'stole', 'out-performed anyone'], ['MY Endgame', 'this movie', 'Blu', 'release'], ['a hint', 'Blurays', 'the convenience', 'ALL', 'MCU'], ['The rest'], ['anyways.I heard', 'a new trilogy', 'Tom Holland', 'role', 'Spidey'], ['this viewing'], ['Tom', 'mediocre', 'much done.Now', 'store']]","[['first time', 'years', 'favorite Spider-Man movie.And', 'kid', 'Ice Age movies', 'part', 'one'], [], ['Nope'], ['minutes', 'movie', 'follow-up', 'favorite of ALL', 'MCU movies'], ['Easy'], ['theatrical-released Spider-Man movies'], ['fact', 'part', 'movies until Spider-Man', 'Tom Holland-led Spider-Man series.I', 'Tom', 'Spider-Man', 'Homecoming', 'Iron Man Jr', 'WAY', 'Iron Man smarts', 'involvement', 'Peter', 'complete moron', 'finger or figure', 'anything', 'big-daddy Tony'], ['Tom', 'Spider-Man', 'Far From Home', 'Tony', 'character', 'franchise'], ['version of Spider-Man', 'Tom Holland', 'dumb Peter', 'others', 'big-daddy Tony'], ['NOT', 'Peter Parker', 'FINALLY', 'Tom', 'third movie'], ['trailer', 'MUCH', 'movie', 'actors', 'trailers', 'last scene', 'movie', 'trailer', 'synopsis'], ['HIGHLY encourage', 'ASAP', 'Spider-Man right'], ['disappointing follow-ups', 'THEY FINALLY GOT SPIDER-MAN BACK ON TRACK.I', 'MCU movie', 'comedy'], ['genuine jokes', 'audience', 'MCU movies', 'action-packed Super-Hero movies'], ['bit', 'uplifting movie'], ['film'], ['Everybody', '%', 'one stole', 'out-performed anyone'], ['MY Endgame', 'movie', 'Blu upon release'], ['hint', 'Blurays', 'convenience', 'ALL', 'MCU movies'], ['rest'], ['anyways.I heard', 'trilogy with Tom Holland', 'role as Spidey'], ['viewing'], ['Tom', 'mediocre', 'much done.Now', 'store']]"

101,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Overhyped and Overrated,"Spider-Man: No Way Home had the potential to be great, but everything didn't really mesh together as it should've. Tobey and Maguire's Spider-Mans didn't really feel like the same versions from all those years ago, or at least that's what I feel. And the villains were all meh except for Doc Oc and Green Goblin, but even these villains weren't as great as they were before. Everything feels watered down in my opinion, and the stakes were just not high enough for me to take enough interest.There are some nice nostalgia scenes and good action pieces, but that's pretty much it. The acting feels cheesy most of the time and there's way too much crying, some people may not mind the amount of crying, but they are really trying to exaggerate the emotions.Spider-Man: No Way Home is a decent movie, 5/10 - 6/10; nowhere near an 8.5.

Though most of the theories aren't true, but it's impressive to witness the fact that it lives up to all the hype. Sheer madness!Without spoiling anything, No Way Home opens umpteenth of possibilities for new plots and world-building in that the next Spiderman trilogy or Marvel films, anything and everything can happen or exist beyond a shadow of a doubt.Mystical and mysterious, this most anticipated film of the year provides a plot that is rarely seen in the superhero cinematic landscape. It's exciting, refreshing and breaking new grounds insofar that it's unpredictable as it keeps on searching for new angles to entice both the old and new generations.People may get disconnected with the plot because it involves time and magic. However, what's so great about No Way Home is in the friendly tone and weight that they present to the audience, making it easy to understand even coming from someone who is not a huge fan of superhero films.Tom Holland powerfully brings everything here to the table. His range of acting and emotional skills has improved tremendously since the predecessor. Even for someone who despises him, you'll be knocking yourself off your feet in no time!Compared to other origin films that opts for typical storytelling, No Way Home attempts to balance humor, drama and action all in one movie and oh my, how it succeeds at that is just one huge jaw-dropping spectacle.As revealed in the trailer, there are plenty of villains await and everyone has a screentime just or almost as much as the others. No one is in the spotlight too little or too much, resulting in an appropriate amount of sheer greatness to introduce back all the bad guys.There are a lot of jokes to spot in this film. However, some of them offer subtlety and puns that you can see it coming only by the help of your own experience and intelligence. Only when you see the film, you'll understand what I'm saying.Never have I seen such a beautiful but haunting ending before. I don't wanna say much here but the ending alone is a masterpiece that it feels like it's coming from an Oscar-worthy film and I'm not exaggerating even one bit.The one thing I dislike here with No Way Home is its cheesiness during the first half. It projects this parody-like vibe that somehow takes us out of the experience a little bit. Even I get a tingling sense that the cameras are just too lazy to shoot the movie.The 2 post-credits scenes are good and exciting but I feel like it doesn't live the hype to all the existing theories on the web. Good but nothing shocking.Verdict: Within 150 minutes, Spiderman No Way Home offers a rollercoaster ride of a thousand of emotions, similar to Infinity War & Endgame and it is definitely the best Marvel origin stand-alone film to date.","[['SPOILERS', 'Everything', 'Endgame'], ['the fact', 'the hype'], ['Sheer', 'madness', 'anything', 'Way Home', 'world-building', 'Spiderman', 'trilogy', 'Marvel', 'anything', 'everything', 'a shadow', 'anticipated film', 'the year', 'a plot', 'the superhero', 'cinematic landscape'], ['new generations.People', 'the plot', 'time', 'magic'], ['Way Home', 'the friendly tone', 'weight', 'the audience', 'someone', 'a huge fan', 'superhero', 'films.Tom', 'Holland', 'everything', 'the table'], ['range', 'the predecessor'], ['someone', 'no time', 'typical storytelling', 'Way Home', 'humor', 'drama', 'action', 'movie', 'huge jaw-dropping', 'spectacle.As', 'the trailer', 'plenty', 'everyone', 'a screentime'], ['No one', 'the spotlight', 'an appropriate amount', 'sheer', 'greatness', 'a lot', 'this film'], ['subtlety', 'the help', 'own experience', 'intelligence'], ['the film'], ['a masterpiece', 'an Oscar-worthy film', 'bit.The', 'thing', 'Way Home', 'cheesiness', 'the first half'], ['this parody-like vibe', 'the experience', 'a little bit'], ['a tingling', 'sense', 'the movie.The', 'the hype', 'the web'], ['nothing', 'shocking.Verdict', 'Spiderman No Way Home', 'a rollercoaster', 'ride', 'a thousand', 'Infinity War', 'Endgame', 'Marvel origin', 'stand-alone', 'film', 'date']]","[['SPOILERS', 'Everything', 'hundreds of theories', 'Endgame'], ['theories', 'fact', 'hype'], ['Sheer madness', 'anything', 'Way Home', 'possibilities', 'new plots and world-building', 'Spiderman trilogy', 'Marvel films', 'anything and everything', 'shadow', 'anticipated film', 'year', 'plot', 'superhero', 'cinematic landscape'], ['new grounds', 'new angles', 'new generations.People', 'plot', 'time and magic'], ['Way Home', 'friendly tone and weight', 'audience', 'someone', 'fan of superhero films.Tom Holland', 'everything', 'table'], ['range', 'emotional skills', 'predecessor'], ['someone', 'feet', 'time', 'other origin films', 'typical storytelling', 'Way Home attempts', 'humor', 'drama and action', 'movie', 'jaw-dropping spectacle.As', 'trailer', 'plenty of villains', 'everyone', 'screentime', 'others'], ['one', 'spotlight', 'amount of sheer greatness', 'lot of jokes', 'film'], ['subtlety', 'help', 'own experience and intelligence'], ['film'], ['na', 'masterpiece', 'Oscar-worthy film', 'bit.The', 'thing', 'Way Home', 'cheesiness', 'first half'], ['projects', 'parody-like vibe', 'experience', 'little bit'], ['tingling sense', 'cameras', 'movie.The', 'post-credits scenes', 'hype', 'theories', 'web'], ['nothing shocking.Verdict', 'minutes', 'Spiderman No Way Home', 'rollercoaster ride', 'thousand of emotions', 'Infinity War', 'Endgame', 'origin stand-alone film', 'date']]"
107,Spider-Man: No Way Home,"The Biggest, Grandest And Most Exhilarating Spidey Flick Ever Appeared On Big Screen!","Spider-Man : No Way Home (2021) -
Movie Review :The first trilogy of Spider-Man, directed by Sam Raimi, has a special place in everyone's heart. Tobey Maguire's Spidey became a memory, nostalgia for the kids who are adults now. After that so-so, decent Amazing Spider-Man, Marvel Studios brought this popular character in Avengers' Universe with Captain America: Civil War (2014) and MCEU fans went crazy. The Superhero got his own films Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Spider-Man (2019), which made Tom Holland a household name. These films had that heroic touch of Iron Man (perhaps the most popular Avenger for the Fans), and now we have No Way Home as a whole new crazy Universe post Endgame. If you love Spider-Man movies, if you love Marvel movies, if you love Doctor Strange and if you love all those villains you saw in Spidey films over the years, then you are gonna enjoy this film like a festival. One hell of cobweb it is, and the Superlative Spidey smashes it in style. But, he is not alone. This is Holland's first Spider-Man film where Tony Stark does not appeared, but still he is not alone. Jon Watts, Marvel and Sony have delivered us a Gigantic Blockbuster Spider-Man Saga as a Christmas Present in advance.Spider-Man: No Way Home trailer was full of story, yet it has a lot of surprises stored for the final product. In the end credit scene of Far From Home we saw Parker being exposed, and now in No Way Home he wants people to forget that. He asks Dr. Stephen Strange makes his identity as Spider-Man a secret again with magic but an overload of time dimensions breaks open the multiverse and allows five supervillains from alternate realities to enter Parker's universe. Parker has to battle out the mess he has created and what more surprises he has to offer, must be kept secret by me. Yes, no spoilers at all. They are busy trending #DontSpoilNoWayHome on Twitter and I respect that. Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers' writing keeps you extremely busy during the watch, while the screenplay has no dull moments whatsoever. Just one condition, you don't have to look for the logic because you're watching a Marvel/Sony's Superhero film, not Christopher Nolan's Cinema.Sony and Marvel Entertainment have made a fantastic film like Spider-Man: Into The Spider Verse (animation), which may remain unbeatable for years. No Way Home is like a Feature Film version of that intelligently nutty film. If I have to pick the best Feature Film (Superhero) recently, then No Way Home certainly tops the list. Jon Watts brings the madness of multiverse and passion of Spider-Verse together in MCU's Spider-Man No Way Home. A combination that will leave fans screaming out for the repeat watch. No Way Home is packed with solid action, fantastic story, lots of surprises; plenty of Heroic stuff, large size explosions, king-size entertainment and last but not the least, touching emotions. It saves a lot of cliches from becoming cliches. The climax will break the hearts of many Spidey fans but that's where the cinematic magic lies. You need an USP factor beyond that regular commercial potboiler, that's what it is. No Way Home will unite Avengers Fans and old Spidey Fans, and this Union is gonna explode at the box office. As a whole, Spider-Man: No Way Home is a smashing Blockbuster. MCU's most exhilarating entertainer post Endgame phenomena and believe it or not, it has the same amount of fans-crazy hysteria. Just go on hooting, no matter how much the ticket costs because the show worths it.RATING - 7/10*","[['Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'Movie Review', 'The first trilogy', 'Spider-Man', 'Sam Raimi', 'a special place', 'everyone', 'heart'], ['Tobey Maguire', 'Spidey', 'a memory', 'nostalgia'], ['Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'Marvel Studios', 'this popular character', 'Avengers', 'Universe', 'Captain America', 'Civil War', 'MCEU'], ['Superhero', 'Homecoming', 'Spider-Man', 'Tom Holland', 'a household', 'name'], ['heroic touch', 'Iron Man', 'Avenger', 'Way Home', 'Universe', 'post', 'Endgame'], ['Marvel', 'Doctor Strange', 'Spidey', 'this film', 'a festival'], ['hell', 'cobweb', 'Superlative Spidey', 'style'], [], ['Holland', 'first Spider-Man', 'film', 'Tony Stark'], ['Jon Watts', 'Marvel', 'Sony', 'Blockbuster Spider-Man Saga', 'Christmas Present', 'advance.Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'trailer', 'story', 'a lot', 'the final product'], ['the end', 'credit', 'scene', 'Far From Home', 'Parker', 'Way Home'], ['Dr. Stephen Strange', 'identity', 'Spider-Man', 'magic', 'an overload', 'time', 'the multiverse', 'Parker', 'universe'], ['Parker', 'battle', 'the mess'], [], ['DontSpoilNoWayHome', 'Twitter'], ['Chris McKenna', 'Erik Sommers', 'the watch', 'the screenplay'], ['condition', 'the logic', 'Marvel/Sony', 'Superhero', 'film', 'Christopher Nolan', 'Cinema.Sony', 'Marvel Entertainment', 'a fantastic film', 'Spider-Man', 'Spider Verse', 'animation'], ['Way Home', 'Feature Film', 'version', 'nutty film'], ['Feature', 'Film', 'Superhero', 'Way Home', 'the list'], ['Jon Watts', 'the madness', 'multiverse', 'passion', 'Spider-Verse together', 'MCU', 'Way Home'], ['A combination', 'the repeat', 'watch'], ['Way Home', 'solid action', 'fantastic story', 'plenty', 'Heroic', 'stuff', 'large size', 'king-size entertainment'], ['a lot'], ['The climax', 'Spidey', 'the cinematic magic'], ['USP', 'factor', 'that regular commercial potboiler'], ['Way Home', 'Spidey Fans', 'Union', 'explode', 'the box', 'office'], ['Way Home', 'Blockbuster'], ['MCU', 'exhilarating entertainer', 'post', 'Endgame', 'phenomena', 'the same amount', 'fans-crazy hysteria'], ['hooting', 'no matter', 'the ticket', 'the show', '*']]","[['Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'Movie Review', 'trilogy of Spider-Man', 'Sam Raimi', 'place in everyone', 'heart'], ['Tobey Maguire', 'Spidey', 'memory', 'nostalgia', 'kids', 'adults'], ['Amazing Spider-Man', 'Marvel Studios', 'character in Avengers', 'Universe with Captain America', 'Civil War', 'MCEU fans'], ['Superhero', 'own films', 'Homecoming', 'Spider-Man', 'Tom Holland', 'household name'], ['films', 'touch of Iron Man', 'popular Avenger', 'Fans', 'Way Home', 'Universe post Endgame'], ['Spider-Man movies', 'Marvel movies', 'Doctor Strange', 'villains', 'Spidey films', 'years', 'film', 'festival'], ['hell of cobweb', 'Superlative Spidey', 'style'], [], ['Holland', 'Spider-Man film', 'Tony Stark'], ['Jon Watts', 'Marvel and Sony', 'Blockbuster Spider-Man Saga', 'Christmas Present', 'advance.Spider-Man', 'Way Home trailer', 'story', 'lot of surprises', 'final product'], ['end credit scene', 'Far From Home', 'Parker', 'Way Home', 'people'], ['Dr. Stephen Strange', 'identity as Spider-Man', 'magic', 'overload of time dimensions breaks', 'multiverse', 'supervillains', 'alternate realities', 'Parker', 'universe'], ['Parker', 'battle', 'mess', 'surprises'], ['spoilers'], ['DontSpoilNoWayHome on Twitter'], ['Chris McKenna', 'Erik Sommers', 'keeps', 'watch', 'screenplay', 'dull moments'], ['condition', 'logic', 'Marvel/Sony', 'Superhero film', 'Christopher Nolan', 'Cinema.Sony', 'Marvel Entertainment', 'film like Spider-Man', 'Spider Verse', 'animation', 'years'], ['Way Home', 'Feature Film version', 'nutty film'], ['Feature Film', 'Superhero', 'Way Home', 'list'], ['Jon Watts', 'madness of multiverse', 'passion', 'together in MCU', 'Way Home'], ['combination', 'fans', 'repeat watch'], ['Way Home', 'solid action', 'fantastic story', 'lots of surprises', 'plenty of Heroic stuff', 'size explosions', 'king-size entertainment', 'emotions'], ['lot of cliches', 'cliches'], ['climax', 'hearts', 'Spidey fans', 'magic lies'], ['USP factor', 'regular commercial potboiler'], ['Way Home', 'Avengers Fans', 'Spidey Fans', 'Union', 'explode', 'box office'], ['Way Home', 'smashing Blockbuster'], ['MCU', 'entertainer post Endgame phenomena', 'same amount', 'fans-crazy hysteria'], ['hooting', 'matter', 'ticket costs', 'show', '*']]"

110,Spider-Man: No Way Home,"Tries really hard, but only reminds of better Spiderman films","After the animated Spider-Man - Into the Spider-Verse, it was an incredibly smart business move by Sony to attempt something similar with their new Spider-Man movie. And considering the mammoth task of juggling so many characters, the overall storyline isn't bad. This could have easily been a far less focused movie tripping all over itself. However, No Way Home trips over something, that isn't its own fault:
The Tom Holland Spider-Man films and universe are just not very interesting. Tom Holland is an okay actor, but his tenure has suffered by having been shoehorned into the other Marvel films, never having had an origin story or even much in terms of character development or motivation.Does anyone remember how his story even began? Everyone remembers Tobey Maguire's Spidey origin. You kind of remember Andrew Garfield's, even if it was almost the exact same story, just less interesting.Tom Holland is a bit of blank state. He does his wide eyed stare and overexcited fast talking thing, but is given very little to work with. Most of the Marvel movies had him on as comic relief, playing second or third fiddle to their mainstay characters.His own movies likewise got bogged down in ""bathos"" humor, constantly winking at the audience and having characters break character for Family Guy style self-referential humor or ""what is happening?"" moments. They were largely plot driven films instead of character driven like the Sam Raimi films.Both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield command the screen whenever they appear in this movie. They slip back into their roles like it was yesterday, and it truly makes me hope that Sony will be brave enough to continue their stories in their respective iterations and universes. Andrew Garfield's films suffered from poor script writing, lame villains and a botched attempt at starting a cinematic universe, but he is extremely charismatic and fun to watch. He almost steals the show here.Willem Dafoe and especially Alfred Molina are fantastic here as well, while Electro and Lizard are unnecessary in an already overpopulated roster. I'm glad they didn't throw Venom in as well (surely they were tempted to).One of the major problems here is that the villains have no relationship to Holland's protagonist, and they have little to no motivation to fight someone they never met. The script demands it though, since these Marvel movies need an action scene ever 20 minutes.The parts where characters are talking are actually a lot more interesting than the fighting scenes, which just grind the narrative to a halt to throw a bunch of noisy CGI crap at the screen. This is especially frustrating at the end, where a giant brawl breaks out for no reason whatsoever right in the middle of the heroes and villains actually negotiating.Zendaya and the comic relief kid are charisma vacuums, with Zendaya failing to act as any kind of emotional anchor to the plot, and the other guy failing to be funny. When they share the screen with the characters from the previous series, it becomes painfully obvious how outclassed they are. Maguire and Dunst shared real on screen chemistry, as did Garfield and Stone.In the end, the best this film has to offer is nostalgia and *hopefully* a path to resurrect the previous Spider-Man film series as Sony does their own thing, separate from the MCU. The MCU is pretty much grasping at straws at this point and burned out much of its audience with six subpar films (Eternals, Shang Chi, Black Widow, Captain Marvel, Far from Home and even Endgame, which was a major step down from Infinity War) and who knows how much terrible filler stuff on TV.Sony would do well to pick up where they left off. A 4th Raimi Spiderman with Maguire would be a box office hit.","[['Spider-Verse', 'smart business', 'move', 'Sony', 'something', 'new Spider-Man movie'], ['the mammoth', 'task', 'the overall storyline'], ['focused movie'], ['Way Home', 'something', 'own fault', 'Tom Holland Spider-Man'], ['Tom Holland', 'an okay actor', 'tenure', 'Marvel', 'an origin story', 'character', 'development', 'anyone', 'story'], ['Everyone', 'Tobey Maguire', 'Spidey', 'origin'], ['kind', 'remember', 'Andrew Garfield', 'the exact same story', 'Holland', 'a bit', 'blank state'], ['stare', 'thing'], ['Marvel', 'comic relief', 'mainstay', 'bathos', 'humor', 'the audience', 'character', 'Family Guy', 'style', 'self-referential humor'], [], ['character', 'Sam Raimi', 'Tobey Maguire', 'Andrew Garfield', 'the screen', 'this movie'], ['yesterday', 'Sony'], ['Andrew Garfield', 'poor script', 'writing', 'lame', 'a botched attempt', 'a cinematic universe', 'fun'], ['the show', 'Dafoe', 'Alfred Molina', 'Electro', 'Lizard', 'roster'], ['Venom', '.One', 'no relationship', 'Holland', 'protagonist', 'no motivation', 'someone'], ['The script', 'Marvel', 'an action', 'scene', 'minutes.The', 'a lot', 'the fighting', 'a halt', 'a bunch', 'CGI', 'crap', 'the screen'], ['the end', 'a giant brawl', 'no reason', 'the middle', 'the comic relief', 'Zendaya', 'any kind', 'emotional anchor', 'the plot', 'the other guy'], ['share', 'the screen', 'the previous series'], ['Maguire', 'Dunst', 'screen chemistry', 'Garfield', 'Stone.In', 'the end', 'this film', '*', 'a path', 'Spider-Man', 'film', 'series', 'Sony', 'own thing', 'MCU'], ['MCU', 'much grasping', 'straws', 'this point', 'audience', 'Shang Chi', 'Black Widow', 'Captain Marvel', 'Far', 'Home', 'Endgame', 'a major step', 'Infinity War', 'much terrible filler', 'stuff', 'TV.Sony'], ['Raimi Spiderman', 'Maguire', 'a box office', 'hit']]","[['Spider-Verse', 'business move', 'Sony', 'something', 'new Spider-Man movie'], ['mammoth task', 'many characters', 'overall storyline'], ['focused movie'], ['Way Home trips', 'something', 'own fault', 'Tom Holland Spider-Man films'], ['Tom Holland', 'okay actor', 'tenure', 'Marvel films', 'origin story', 'terms of character development', 'motivation.Does anyone', 'story'], ['Everyone remembers Tobey Maguire', 'Spidey origin'], ['kind of remember Andrew Garfield', 'exact same story', 'interesting.Tom Holland', 'bit', 'blank state'], ['stare', 'thing'], ['Marvel movies', 'comic relief', 'third fiddle', 'mainstay characters.His', 'own movies', 'bathos', 'humor', 'audience', 'characters', 'character for Family Guy style', 'self-referential humor'], ['moments'], ['films', 'character', 'Sam Raimi', 'Tobey Maguire', 'Andrew Garfield', 'screen', 'movie'], ['roles', 'yesterday', 'Sony', 'stories', 'respective iterations and universes'], ['Andrew Garfield', 'films', 'script writing', 'lame villains', 'botched attempt', 'cinematic universe', 'fun'], ['show', 'Dafoe', 'Alfred Molina', 'Electro and Lizard', 'roster'], ['Venom', '.One', 'major problems', 'villains', 'relationship', 'Holland', 'protagonist', 'motivation', 'someone'], ['script', 'Marvel movies', 'action scene', 'minutes.The parts', 'characters', 'lot', 'fighting scenes', 'halt', 'bunch', 'CGI crap', 'screen'], ['end', 'brawl breaks', 'reason', 'middle', 'heroes and villains', 'relief kid', 'charisma vacuums', 'Zendaya', 'kind', 'emotional anchor', 'plot', 'other guy'], ['share', 'screen', 'characters', 'previous series'], ['Maguire and Dunst', 'screen chemistry', 'Garfield and Stone.In', 'end', 'film', '*', 'path', 'Spider-Man film series', 'Sony', 'own thing', 'MCU'], ['MCU', 'grasping at straws', 'point', 'audience', 'subpar films', 'Eternals', 'Shang Chi', 'Black Widow', 'Captain Marvel', 'Far from Home', 'Endgame', 'major step', 'Infinity War', 'filler stuff', 'TV.Sony'], ['Raimi Spiderman', 'Maguire', 'office hit']]"
111,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Epic and satisfying Spider Man movie ever with action and surprises.,"5 out of 5 stars.Spider-Man: No Way Home is an epic, big, and one of the best Spider Man films of all time. Literally nothing is holding this film back which the script contains about everything. And director Jon Watts making the best spider man movie ever. Fans and non fans are going to love the film. The story is best to go without any spoilers. There are many surprises that will leave the crowd cheering. Story also goes into an emotional direction and making the film feeling like a conclusion to the trilogy. Characters story arcs coming to an end. While opening up more possibilities to where the direction can go.No Way Home does the third film of concluding the story right unlike Amazing Spider man movie or the original third film where they cram up so many villains and a story that can barely hold it together. No Way Home script managed to balance the story and characters out. This film does have several villains. A lot of returning villains that is a lot of fun surprises and even with a new look. Peter Parker facing each one of them and trying to stop them is awesome. The plot is great. It can try to go in a emotional direction. There is also a fun brief appearance of another character which is cool to see and hoping to see more of them in future mcu films someday.The action sequences are awesome and stylistic. Spider man fight scenes are amazing. The visual effects are brilliant. The cinematography is well done in capturing the action scenes. The music score is different by Michael Giacchino but great. The cast ensemble did a great job. Like I said earlier, the appearances making a return is a lot of fun. For a long run time, the film does feel short and very fast moving which keeps your eyes glued to the screen.The climax battle is epic and exciting. Spider Man facing multiple villains is one of the best action scenes ever. It can be a bit dark. The action scene with Spider Man and Doctor Strange chasing each other through the mirror dimension is stunning.Overall, No Way Home is one of the best Marvel films ever. And one of the best Spider man movies. It is big, epic, and the script and direction had a lot of surprises. I am hoping to see Jon Watts take on another Marvel project.There is a fun mid credit scene that hints for where the direction can go. And a post credit scene that hints of where mcu is going next.","[['stars.Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'an epic', 'Spider', 'Man', 'all time'], ['nothing', 'this film', 'the script', 'everything'], ['director', 'Jon Watts', 'spider', 'man', 'movie'], ['the film'], ['The story'], ['the crowd', 'cheering'], ['Story', 'an emotional direction', 'the film', 'feeling', 'a conclusion', 'the trilogy'], ['story', 'an end'], ['the direction', 'Way Home', 'the third film', 'the story', 'Amazing Spider', 'man', 'movie', 'the original third film', 'a story'], ['Way Home', 'script', 'the story'], ['This film'], ['A lot', 'a lot', 'fun', 'a new look'], ['Peter Parker'], ['The plot'], ['a emotional direction'], ['a fun', 'brief appearance', 'another character', 'future mcu', 'someday.The action'], ['Spider', 'man', 'fight'], [], ['The cinematography', 'the action'], ['The music', 'score', 'Michael Giacchino'], ['The cast', 'ensemble', 'a great job'], ['a return', 'a lot', 'fun'], ['a long run', 'time', 'the film', 'the screen.The', 'climax', 'battle'], ['Spider Man', 'action'], ['a bit'], ['The action', 'scene', 'Spider Man', 'Doctor Strange', 'the mirror', 'dimension', 'Way Home', 'Marvel'], ['Spider', 'man'], ['epic', 'the script', 'direction', 'a lot'], ['Jon Watts', 'Marvel', 'project.There', 'a fun', 'mid', 'credit', 'scene', 'the direction'], ['a post', 'credit', 'scene', 'mcu']]","[['stars.Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'epic', 'Spider Man films', 'time'], ['nothing', 'film', 'script', 'everything'], ['director Jon Watts', 'spider man movie'], ['Fans', 'non fans', 'film'], ['story', 'spoilers'], ['many surprises', 'crowd cheering'], ['Story', 'emotional direction', 'film feeling', 'conclusion', 'trilogy'], ['Characters story', 'end'], ['possibilities', 'direction', 'Way Home', 'third film', 'story', 'Amazing Spider man movie', 'original third film', 'many villains', 'story'], ['Way Home script', 'story and characters'], ['film', 'several villains'], ['lot', 'villains', 'lot of fun surprises', 'new look'], ['Peter Parker'], ['plot'], ['emotional direction'], ['fun', 'brief appearance', 'character', 'mcu films', 'action sequences'], ['Spider man fight scenes'], ['visual effects'], ['cinematography', 'action scenes'], ['music score', 'Michael Giacchino'], ['cast ensemble', 'great job'], ['appearances', 'return', 'lot of fun'], ['run time', 'film', 'eyes', 'screen.The climax battle'], ['Spider Man', 'multiple villains', 'action scenes'], ['bit'], ['action scene', 'Spider Man', 'Doctor Strange', 'mirror dimension', 'Way Home', 'Marvel films'], ['Spider man movies'], ['epic', 'script and direction', 'lot of surprises'], ['Jon Watts', 'Marvel project.There', 'fun mid credit scene', 'direction'], ['post credit scene', 'hints', 'mcu']]"

113,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Spider-Man: No Way Home Delivers Epic Marvel Action And Plenty Of Surprises,"Life for Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is complicated thanks to his dual life as Spider-Man and the challenges of being in High School. Unfortunately for him; his best intentions are about to make things much worse in ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"".Taking place where ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" ended; Peter must deal with his secret identity being leaked by Tabloid Journalist J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons); and the throngs of people, helicopters, and protestors who follow his every move and camp outside his home.As if this was not bad enough; being accused of being a murderer has drawn the attention of the authorities which further complicates his life as does returning to a school where everyone knows his identity.Desperate to get away from the constant scrutiny and observation; Peter seeks out Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and asks him to cast a spell that would make the world forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.Strange agrees but mid-spell Peter requests that there are some exemptions from the spell which include his Girlfriend MJ (Zendaya); his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei); and his friend Ned (Jacob Batalon).Strange agrees but in doing so; complications arise which allows entrants from other dimensions to enter their realm. Soon Peter is accosted by villains whom he does not know but seem to know him; that is until he is unmasked and they have no idea who this Peter Parker is before them.As more villains arrive; Peter learns of their fates in their natural dimension and is determined to save them and give them a second chance which puts him at odds with Doctor Strange who says they must go back to whatever fate they had.What follows is a descent into humor and darkness as Peter despite his best intentions sees the situation go from bad to worse and he must fight to stay true to himself and save the day.The film is a difficult one to review in the fact that there are so many surprise guests, twists, and turns that it is challenging to not reveal anything but suffice it to say that fans should absolutely enjoy it.The film takes its time getting to the action as it has a very slow and deliberate climb and Director Jon Watts is confident enough in the characters and premise that he allows ample time for the characters and setting to build and be established before he gets to the action.While there is considerable fan service in the film; it never once seems like it is pandering and it all fits very well within the story and the MCU and opens up numerous possibilities for the future.There is a mid-credit scene and a post-credit scene which is basically a trailer and both are very engaging in terms of the possibilities as Marvel has again shown that their plan of interwoven stories and characters continues to deliver and that Spider-Man still remains as popular and engaging as ever.","[['Life', 'Peter Parker', 'Tom Holland', 'dual life', 'Spider-Man', 'High School'], ['Way Home', 'place', 'Far', 'Home', 'Peter', 'secret identity', 'Tabloid Journalist J.

120,Spider-Man: No Way Home,I'm NOT the target audience for this film,"I am not the target audience. I don't mind Marvel films, I don't even mind comics, but I don't obsess over them in the way some people do (and it is fine that they get enjoyment from these films). This review is for people like myself, if you're a fan of Marvel and Spiderman then - simply put - you will love the film.For me, I found I was bored. The running time is long, the story is a little ""meh"" (Spiderman wants to SAVE the villains) and everything is just a little too convenient with plot points coming that are obvious from the get go. In short: It's a cookie-cut film. Marvel has their formula (and clearly it works for them) and they won't stray from that. Sorry, but I am in Ridley Scott's camp. There's no originality anymore.By now you probably already know that other faces do pop up in the film. There are some fun scenes with these characters and I chuckled a couple of times but - the rest of the audience was whooping, cheering and clapping which actually bugged me more as - it meant I missed a lot of dialogue after a character's reveal. Seriously, if you want to chat loudly - stay at home and watch the film instead of forcing others to listen to your inane thoughts.Tom Holland is good as Spiderman and, in this film, he shows a lot of range with his emotion - which was great to see because, until this film, we hadn't really seen that from him but, really, he is the only positive I can think of when it comes to this film. By tomorrow, I would have forgotten most of what I'd just watched.It's average at best. If you're a fan boy, it's the best Marvel film yet.

131,Spider-Man: No Way Home,The biggest and arguably best Spider-Man outing yet,"THIS IS A SPOILER FREE REVIEW!There's not much chance of devoted Spidey/Marvel fans walking away from Jon Watt's and Tom Holland's latest web-slinging adventure without a strong sense of satisfaction from an epic outing, that in many ways feels as grand and risky as when the world first wondered how Marvel would manage to bring The Avengers to life all the way back in 2012.The third trip between director Watt's and his leading man, that sees the groundwork laid before it combine here in a loaded and fan servicing collaboration, to talk about No Way Home without giving away its many narrative treasures and likely iconic pop culture moments is a difficult task but there's reason to believe even early on in its release that this Spider-Man outing will go down as one of, if not the best big screen solo outings for the local neighborhood vigilante yet.As is always the case with such loaded Marvel outings, there are a few narrative conveniences that don't hold up to much examination and a few half-explored ideas but too dwell on these moments would be a waste of ones time when there's so much joy, fun and even unexcepted emotion to be found in Watt's film as Parker and his offsiders find themselves battling a severe multiverse problem that threatens to derail the world as we know it.Filled with an abundance of action set pieces, well-known Marvel comedic beats, more throwbacks and nods to lore than almost any other Marvel film before it and fun character interactions, what is perhaps most surprising of all about this high reaching adventure is the wealth of strong performances found within it from one of the most stacked casts the long running superhero brand has seen yet.From the expected and unexpected cast additions, everyone here brings their A-game with Holland and Zendaya as the loving couple getting great moments together and feeling well and truly like they've both become their respective characters in body and soul, while other returning cast members from both recent and less recent times all appear to care more than just a paycheck collection would suggest giving No Way Home a strong sense of purpose and heart, with the small moments making more of an impact than the films various action oriented segments.Likely to be a film that is explored multiple times and one that is sure to provide hidden moments of joy and satisfaction to those that delve back into it across the ensuing years, No Way Home is another groundbreaking achievement from Marvel who could've easily sat back and enjoyed their success after the events of Endgame but have continued to push the boundaries of blockbuster movie making as they keep looking to provide us with top notch entertainment that is undeniable and unmatched in quality.Final Say -There's no doubt about the fact that Spider-Man: No Way Home is the biggest and arguably best Spider-Man outing yet. A stunning achievement in pushing forward while also acknowledging the past, things here might not be perfect but there's too much to like here to deny that Marvel has once more raised the bar for the comic book cinematic landscape.4 imprisoned trees out of 5Check out my film blog Jordan and Eddie for more reviews!","[['THIS', 'SPOILER FREE REVIEW', 'much chance', 'Spidey/Marvel', 'Jon Watt', 'Tom Holland', 'web-slinging adventure', 'a strong sense', 'satisfaction', 'an epic', 'outing', 'the world', 'Marvel', 'life', 'the way', 'third trip', 'director', 'Watt', 'leading man', 'the groundwork', 'laid', 'collaboration', 'Way Home', 'likely iconic pop', 'culture', 'a difficult task', 'reason', 'release', 'this Spider-Man outing', 'big screen', 'solo', 'the local neighborhood', 'vigilante', 'yet.As', 'the case', 'Marvel', 'much examination', 'a waste', 'time', 'much joy', 'fun', 'unexcepted emotion', 'Watt', 'film', 'Parker', 'a severe multiverse', 'problem', 'the world', 'an abundance', 'action', 'Marvel', 'comedic', 'Marvel', 'film', 'character', 'this high reaching', 'adventure', 'the wealth', 'the long running', 'superhero', 'brand', 'unexpected cast', 'everyone', 'Holland', 'Zendaya', 'couple', 'body', 'soul', 'a paycheck', 'collection', 'Way Home', 'a strong sense', 'purpose', 'heart', 'an impact', 'various action', 'a film', 'joy', 'satisfaction', 'Way Home', 'achievement', 'Marvel', 'success', 'Endgame', 'blockbuster', 'movie', 'top notch', 'entertainment', 'Say -There', 'no doubt', 'the fact', 'Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'Spider-Man outing'], ['A stunning achievement', 'forward', 'the past', 'Marvel', 'the bar', 'the comic book', 'cinematic landscape.4', 'film', 'blog', 'Jordan', 'Eddie']]","[['THIS', 'SPOILER FREE REVIEW', 'much chance', 'Spidey/Marvel fans', 'Jon Watt', 'Tom Holland', 'web-slinging adventure', 'sense of satisfaction', 'epic outing', 'ways feels', 'world', 'Marvel', 'Avengers', 'life', 'way', 'trip between director Watt', 'leading man', 'groundwork laid', 'collaboration', 'Way Home', 'many narrative treasures', 'pop culture moments', 'difficult task', 'reason', 'release', 'Spider-Man outing', 'screen solo outings', 'neighborhood vigilante yet.As', 'case', 'Marvel outings', 'few narrative conveniences', 'much examination', 'few half-explored ideas', 'moments', 'waste of ones time', 'much joy', 'fun', 'unexcepted emotion', 'Watt', 'film as Parker', 'offsiders', 'multiverse problem', 'world', 'abundance of action', 'pieces', 'Marvel comedic beats', 'throwbacks and nods', 'Marvel film', 'character interactions', 'reaching adventure', 'wealth', 'strong performances', 'stacked casts', 'running superhero brand', 'cast additions', 'everyone', 'Holland and Zendaya', 'couple', 'great moments', 'characters in body', 'soul', 'cast members', 'recent times', 'paycheck collection', 'Way Home', 'sense of purpose', 'heart', 'small moments', 'impact', 'films', 'various action', 'film', 'multiple times', 'moments of joy', 'satisfaction', 'years', 'Way Home', 'achievement from Marvel', 'success', 'events of Endgame', 'boundaries of blockbuster movie', 'notch entertainment', 'Say -There', 'doubt', 'fact that Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'Spider-Man outing'], ['stunning achievement', 'forward', 'past', 'things', 'Marvel', 'bar', 'comic book', 'cinematic landscape.4', 'trees', 'film blog Jordan', 'Eddie', 'reviews']]"
132,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Marvel's writing problem plagues what could have been the best Spiderman movie ever,"(No Spoilers)Spiderman: No Way Home is probably the biggest superhero movie since Avengers Endgame... There's no denying that. Ever since this movie's announcement, you knew this was a bigger deal than the usual superhero flicks. And being a movie with such high expectations, means that there's so much room for things to go wrong. And unfortunately... It seems like it did.Now I'm fresh out of the theatre, and I already feel like this movie had so much potential wasted. A sentiment I also share towards Avengers Endgame; where the only thing the writers seemed to worry about was 'fan-service'. Fan service is fine honestly, but the line should be when fan-service slowly starts taking over for storytelling. Because the storytelling in this movie was childish.Don't get me wrong... I enjoyed the movie... I enjoyed the theatre experience... It was fun... But fun is not enough when you realize what could have been. Spiderman: No Way Home could have been Marvel's most ambitious project yet, but it has the curse of Marvel's horrible writing staff who similarly messed up everything from Avengers Endgame, to WandaVision, to Falcon and the Winter Soldier, to Loki and to Black Widow. The plot of the movie sounds like some cheap fan fiction that somehow got made. And what's even worse is its absolutely cringe worthy dialogue; existing for the sole purpose of reminding the audience of previous Spiderman movies. It's such a dumb and convenient plot that just exists for the sake of nostalgia.I loved Avengers Infinity War and I really enjoyed Spiderman Far From Home, but I haven't enjoyed a single Marvel project since, because all their projects have been so shallow with no real substance to back itself up. Marvel has a writing problem that needs to be looked into, for the sake of cinema and storytelling.What a missed opportunity...

However, with the first emotional event of the film, everything changes. First, with a lot of fan service and some weird changes on the tone (I still don't get how MCU wants everybody to move from crying a lot to laughing hard in the next minute), but always growing to a very strong third act on an epic battle (even if slightly confusing).There are problems. The fan service - already mentioned - is simply too much. It's not only what you are thinking. It's remembering all the single moments you can imagine, it's in a lot of dialogue, lots of lines and mostly is there only to tell you ""hey, I'm here, remember?"". But what works mainly as a gimmick supports a very good emotional arc, which happens for the first time on this trilogy.

135,Spider-Man: No Way Home,A Full Spidey Fan Service,"No Way Home is undeniably the most emotional and the most entertaining of Tom Holland's Spider-Man. It's a full Spidey Fan Service for sure. While in Homecoming and Far From Home, Peter Parker's character felt quite childish, this film would show the transititon of a more grown-up Peter Parker, and Tom Holland did really well for making it happen. Of course No Way Home has many surprises that I won't spoil, but don't expect too much on storyline. The plot is pretty simple actually, and the trailer had already shown almost all the plot.

139,Spider-Man: No Way Home,The best Spider-Man movie...,"""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" is an Action - Fantasy movie and the third movie of the ""Spider-Man"" franchise, in which we follow the story of Spider-Man after ""Spider-Man: Far from Home"". Everybody knows the true identity of Spider-Man and Doctor Strange can help Peter with a spell. Everything change when this spell goes wrong.I enjoyed this movie very much because it had an amazing plot, contained plenty of action scenes and much of suspense. Regarding the plot, there were some plot twists that I did not expect so, it was a nice surprise and something that made the movie even more interesting and enjoyable. The direction which was made by Jon Watts was very good and he used wisely both information and characters to create this special movie. The interpretations of Tom Holland who played as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, Alfred Molina who played as Dr. Otto Octavius / Doc Ock, Benedict Cumberbatch who played as Doctor Strange and Willem Dafoe who played as Norman Osborn / Green Goblin were simply fantastic and their combination worked very well and created an outstanding result. All in all, I have to say that ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" is one of the best Marvel movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it.","[['Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'Action', 'Fantasy', 'movie', 'the third movie', 'franchise', 'the story', 'Spider-Man', 'Far', 'Home'], ['Everybody', 'the true identity', 'Spider-Man', 'Doctor Strange', 'Peter', 'a spell'], ['Everything', 'change', 'this spell', 'this movie', 'an amazing plot', 'plenty', 'action', 'suspense'], ['the plot', 'some plot', 'a nice surprise', 'something', 'the movie'], ['The direction', 'Jon Watts', 'both information', 'this special movie'], ['Tom Holland', 'Peter Parker / Spider-Man', 'Alfred Molina', 'Dr. Otto Octavius / Doc Ock', 'Benedict Cumberbatch', 'Doctor Strange', 'Willem Dafoe', 'Norman Osborn / Green Goblin', 'combination', 'an outstanding result'], ['Way Home', 'Marvel movie', 'everyone']]","[['Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'Action', 'Fantasy movie', 'third movie', 'franchise', 'story of Spider-Man', 'Far from Home'], ['Everybody', 'identity of Spider-Man', 'Doctor Strange', 'Peter', 'spell'], ['Everything change', 'spell', 'movie', 'amazing plot', 'plenty of action scenes', 'suspense'], ['plot', 'plot twists', 'nice surprise and something', 'movie'], ['direction', 'Jon Watts', 'information and characters', 'special movie'], ['interpretations of Tom Holland', 'Peter Parker / Spider-Man', 'Alfred Molina', 'Dr. Otto Octavius / Doc Ock', 'Benedict Cumberbatch', 'Doctor Strange', 'Willem Dafoe', 'Norman Osborn / Green Goblin', 'combination', 'outstanding result'], ['Way Home', 'Marvel movie', 'everyone']]"
140,Spider-Man: No Way Home,"Underwhelming, Relies too Much on Nostalgia","As a huge Doctor Strange fan who is more than ready for more of the multiverse, I had very high expectations for No Way Home. Unfortunately, it was a let down. Sure it caters to fans with some nostalgic moments, but relies way way way too much on the fan service while lacking in pretty much all other areas. The story was all over the place, pacing was very wishy-washy, and the writing was horrendous for the most part. It felt very childish and cheap at a lot of moments with jokes that just did not land at all and some super corny dialogue. My best friend and I were genuinely confused at the amount of laughs, cheers, and claps from our audience in the theater tonight (and we are both very big Marvel fans, my best friend being a long-time, devoted spidey fan). So believe me when I tell you that we really wanted to love this movie. Honestly our favorite part of the entire film was the post-credits features. If anything, this movie only further solidified my belief that Tom Holland is the weakest of the Spider-Mans. Not necessarily his fault, but rather the fault of the writers for trying way too hard to make him a quirky, shy, stuttery, awkward teenager and not giving him any real development or depth to his character aside from maybe the two seconds after May's death and his fight with Osborn where we see a glimpse of a dark side in him, but that's it. Additionally, killing off May was just so lame. It reeked of ""we need to kill off a character for some kind of shock value but not anyone too important"". Another moment that I don't understand is when Toby is seemingly fatally injured in a sudden and surprising moment towards the end of the film, but then is all of a sudden okay a few minutes later? There were just too many moments that felt like it was relying on audience reactions and surprise in order to come across as a good movie. I think the main reason it is receiving such praise right now is because of the current hype around Andrew and Toby reprising their roles (which was great fun don't get me wrong), but in the long run didn't feel like it served much of a purpose to the actual story beyond wanting to drop a bombshell on fans. By the fifth conversation/conflict about how Peter can ""cure"" the villains and save the world, the entire movie became a jumbled and chaotic mess.

158,Spider-Man: No Way Home,"This movie was so insanely good; Best Spider-Man film ever (Yes, seriously)","This is it. It's what we've all been waiting for. This is the Infinity War equivalent for the Spider-Man movies, it's the most ambitious cross-over in the history of Spider-Man, and honestly, the most ambitious cross-over since Infinity War.Insane cast, Willem Dafoe brings an Oscar-worthy performance, Tom Holland and Marisa Tomei both bring their dramatic A-game, Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield reprising their roles with heartfelt intensity, Alfred Molina and Jamie Foxx are incredible antagonists (though as far as villains go, Dafoe steals the show, just as Garfield does for the good guys).Insane fan service. Great intro of Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock in official MCU capacity. Fantastic way to bring back Garfield and Maguire. Great choice of villains, even if the 6th member of the Sinister Six was getting drunk in Mexico. We finally get an official ""With great power, comes great responsibility"". Nice meme material, ""You know, I'm something of a scientist myself"" and ""my back"". The fan service here didn't feel forced.Great action. CGI wasn't the best the MCU has to offer, but absolutely gets the job done. I think as the Dr. Strange's skills as a sorcerer have improved, so too have the creativity of the visuals used to depict his spells. Very fresh feel of the mirror dimension this time around, looking forward to seeing it again in the next Dr. Strange film.Most of all, it's a great story. The character growth is dynamic and well paced. It happens on all facets and it's very clear that the writers and Jon Watts have taken to heart criticism of the first two MCU Spider-Man films. There's the heart-wrenching loss of Aunt May (never gets easier to see any Spider-Man losing someone), a serious stepping up of Tom Holland's Peter Parker to be more than just an Iron Man Jr., and an apologetic reminder that Parker is broke (and not a Stark trust fund kid), both during the movie and once again at the end, when his slate is wiped clean. Garfield gets a chance to save Holland's MJ in a very dramatic mini-""redemption arc"". The best part of the script is the motif that Spider-Man's best attribute is his incredible moral compass, and great moral strength, willing to take on all the pain and sacrifice so that his friends and neighborhood can live on prosperously even if he gets left behind. It's an echo that establishes the Spider-Man at the end of the film as a spiritual successor to Capt. America more strongly than it does as an Iron Man Jr. The growth that Maguire and Garfield's Spider-Men bring in helping Holland's Spider-Man realize that vengeance is not what Aunt May would have wanted, and by extension, is not the Spider-Man way is incredibly touching and a fantastic dynamic for the three Spider-Men. Toby Maguire's goodbye in the movie ""You know. It's what we do"" to Tom Holland is a great send-off and acknowledgement that the mantle of Spider-Man is never an easy one to wear, but it's one that Spider-Men in every universe wear with great power and responsibility.Spider-Man: No Way Home is a tale of sacrifice, growth, and redemption. Say what you will about the quantity of the MCU, but the quality of select films like Spider-Man: No Way Home is undeniable, and I hope this isn't the last time we see an adventure as epic as this was.","[[], [], ['Infinity War', 'equivalent', 'ambitious cross-over', 'the history', 'Spider-Man', 'ambitious cross-over', 'Infinity War.Insane', 'cast', 'Willem Dafoe', 'an Oscar-worthy performance', 'Tom Holland', 'Marisa Tomei', 'A-game', 'Toby Maguire', 'Andrew Garfield', 'heartfelt', 'intensity', 'Alfred Molina', 'Jamie Foxx', 'Dafoe', 'the show', 'Garfield', 'fan service'], ['Great', 'intro', 'Charlie Cox', 'Matt Murdock', 'MCU', 'capacity'], ['Fantastic way', 'Garfield', 'Maguire'], ['Great', 'choice', 'member', 'Sinister Six', 'drunk', 'Mexico'], ['great power', 'great responsibility'], ['Nice meme', 'material', 'something', 'a scientist', 'back'], ['The fan', 'service', 'forced.Great action'], ['CGI', 'MCU', 'the job'], ['Dr'], ['Strange', 'a sorcerer', 'the creativity'], ['fresh feel', 'the mirror', 'dimension', 'this time', 'Dr'], ['Strange film.Most', 'a great story'], ['The character', 'growth'], ['Jon Watts', 'heart', 'criticism', 'MCU'], ['the heart-wrenching loss', 'Aunt May', 'Spider-Man', 'losing', 'someone', 'Tom Holland', 'Peter Parker', 'Iron Man Jr.', 'an apologetic reminder', 'Parker', 'Stark', 'trust', 'fund', 'kid', 'the movie', 'the end', 'slate', 'wiped clean'], ['Garfield', 'a chance', 'Holland', 'MJ', 'dramatic mini-', 'redemption', 'arc'], ['part', 'the script', 'the motif', 'Spider-Man', 'attribute', 'incredible moral compass', 'great moral strength', 'the pain', 'sacrifice', 'neighborhood', 'behind'], ['an echo', 'the Spider-Man', 'the end', 'the film', 'a spiritual successor', 'Capt'], ['America', 'Iron Man Jr'], ['The growth', 'Maguire', 'Garfield', 'Spider-Men bring', 'Holland', 'Spider-Man realize', 'vengeance', 'Aunt May', 'extension', 'the Spider-Man way', 'a fantastic dynamic', 'Spider-Men'], ['Toby Maguire', 'goodbye', 'the movie'], ['Tom Holland', 'a great send-off', 'acknowledgement', 'the mantle', 'Spider-Man', 'Spider-Men', 'every universe', 'wear', 'great power', 'responsibility.Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'a tale', 'sacrifice', 'growth', 'redemption'], ['the quantity', 'MCU', 'the quality', 'Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'the last time', 'an adventure']]","[[], [], ['Infinity War equivalent', 'Spider-Man movies', 'ambitious cross-over', 'history of Spider-Man', 'cross-over since Infinity War.Insane cast', 'Willem Dafoe', 'Oscar-worthy performance', 'Tom Holland', 'Marisa Tomei', 'dramatic A-game', 'Toby Maguire', 'Andrew Garfield', 'roles with heartfelt intensity', 'Alfred Molina', 'Jamie Foxx', 'incredible antagonists', 'villains', 'Dafoe', 'show', 'Garfield', 'good guys', 'fan service'], ['Great intro', 'Charlie Cox', 'Matt Murdock', 'MCU capacity'], ['Fantastic way', 'Garfield and Maguire'], ['Great choice', 'villains', 'member', 'Sinister Six', 'drunk in Mexico'], ['great power', 'great responsibility'], ['meme material', 'something', 'scientist', 'back'], ['fan service', 'forced.Great action'], ['CGI', 'MCU', 'job'], ['Dr'], ['Strange', 'skills', 'sorcerer', 'creativity', 'visuals', 'spells'], ['fresh feel', 'mirror dimension', 'time', 'next Dr'], ['Strange film.Most', 'great story'], ['character growth'], ['facets', 'writers', 'Jon Watts', 'heart criticism', 'MCU', 'Spider-Man films'], ['loss of Aunt May', 'Spider-Man losing someone', 'Tom Holland', 'Peter Parker', 'Iron Man Jr.', 'reminder that Parker', 'Stark trust fund kid', 'movie', 'end', 'slate', 'wiped clean'], ['Garfield', 'chance', 'Holland', 'MJ', 'dramatic mini-', 'redemption arc'], ['part', 'script', 'motif that Spider-Man', 'attribute', 'incredible moral compass', 'great moral strength', 'pain and sacrifice', 'friends and neighborhood', 'behind'], ['echo', 'Spider-Man', 'end', 'film', 'spiritual successor', 'Capt'], ['America', 'Iron Man Jr'], ['growth that Maguire', 'Garfield', 'Spider-Men bring', 'Holland', 'realize that vengeance', 'Aunt May', 'extension', 'Spider-Man way', 'fantastic dynamic', 'Spider-Men'], ['Toby Maguire', 'goodbye', 'movie'], ['Tom Holland', 'great send-off and acknowledgement', 'mantle of Spider-Man', 'Spider-Men', 'universe wear', 'great power and responsibility.Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'tale of sacrifice', 'growth', 'redemption'], ['quantity', 'MCU', 'quality', 'films like Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'last time', 'adventure']]"
159,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Junk Food of a Movie,"I am pretty stunned that this movie is as popular as it is. It's basically a contrived gimmick to pull together the characters from past Spidey incarnations and crack a lot of jokes.I have never been a fan of Tom Holland's take on Spiderman as a good hearted teen-ager being overly deferential to every adult he deals with. It's a one-note performance and from the start it's been contrived and unconvincing. Andrew Garfield relied on looking at the ground and foot-shuffling when he was trying to portray Spiderman. Holland just calls everyone 'Sir' all the time.So...in a stupid corny contrived scene, Spiderman can't shut up long enough to allow Dr. Strange to cast a spell and everything is set in motion. Dimensional reality is breached and the other Spider Men from other Universes wind up in the new Spider Man's reality. So do all the old baddies from the old movies. Doc Occ/Goblin/SandMan/Electro/Lizard Man. So the three Spideys + Zendaya and her giant nose and Spider's Nerd Pal join together to correct the histories of multiple universes and they succeed but at a huge cost.There is a ton of 'jokey' humour in this junk food burger that doesn't work. There are standard Marvel CGI effects. There are a strangely bunch of complacent half-hearted no motivation baddies.The whole thing is horribly contrived, doesn't make sense, the characters don't act in sensible fashion, and our Hero is left with nothing but his super-hero identity....which we are left with the idea that that is all he needs because it is his destiny.Plot wise this movie was as bad as The Eternals.

163,Spider-Man: No Way Home,"Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear ...","Look at the shiny-shiny ... and then it all unfolded with a tedious inevitability - (sound familiar?). This is a review without spoilers; however, let's be honest people, this is a stunningly awful presentation. If real people really liked it, then more power to you: you're easily entertained and that's nice; if you seriously hated it, then congratulations for your honesty at feeling irritated, conned, duped, and mislead. In no way does this (I refuse to call it a movie) walking-talking-jumping-moaning tapestry deserve any plaudits, prizes, appreciation, or recommendations.

I've grown tired of movies relying on CGI Hero Landing poses, quips, and ridiculous set-ups; truly, with such a budget, why can these people not develop an actual story, a story with substance, meaning, and purpose? Why is there no proof-reading-editor-director-producer with a modicum of intelligence to address the profuse series of ridiculous, asinine, preposterous, discrepant, and utter puerile nonsense shoehorned and stapled together sequence of scenes that they packed together and served up as the best ever movie ever made in the history of cinema everywhere for ever, and ever, amen. Honestly now people, those rating this as a triumph, oh come on, you do realise that this is not the most spectacular moment in your life, right?

165,Spider-Man: No Way Home,You have no idea what this movie alone has accomplished. Setting everyone and everything off in the greatest way possible while delivering pure entertainment.,"The MCU Spider-Man has finally arrived. I had to take some time for this experience to sink in and assimilate what it alone has accomplished in a 2h runtime. Well done, Marvel, well done.For those who criticised this movie of having a ""pandering"" fan service or messy plot didn't quite understand the main purpose and theme of the movie. I am not excusing its possible filmmaking-related flaws, but it never set out to be flawless in the first place and I love that about it.This movie wasn't only about pleasing fans but it was also about providing Tom Holland's Spider-Man of the wake up call it so desperately needed. Everyone who criticised the MCU portrayal of Spider-Man has been proven wrong as the character has evolved and matured over the course of the movies to reach the portrayal we all know and love. Far From Home was a step in the right direction from Homecoming, but this one is the pinnacle of it all. I have to give it to screen writters and everyone creatively involved in the movie from a story perspective because they have outdone themselves. This movie, while not exempt of filmmaking flaws and contrivances, has delivered what we never thought we needed. Maybe it's me, maybe I'm blinded by the fact that any and all plot devices used in this movie are of my liking. In a world of magic and sci-fi, political disputes and spionage are rendered a bit underwhelming to me.About the fan service, this is fan service done right, because it services the story. The multiversal backdrop serves primarily for two things: redemption and realisation. I don't want to get into too much spoilers, but certain characters and emotional moments return to redeem characters who need redemption and for others to realise that actions have consequences. Something that we finally see in an MCU Spider-Man movie, something that ever since its comicbook conception in the 1970s has defined and established the character as one of the best in the industry.Like Dave Filoni said about Star Wars: ""It's not really about what we decorate it with (x-wings, lightsabers, aliens) but the familial conflicts, the emotional turmoil that defines Star Wars and sets it apart from the rest"". Spider-man is not what we decorate it with, is not only about the swinging, the villains, the crazy adventures, it's about the human element, it's about how these affect the Man in Spider-Man. I have always been more fascinated with the portions of the comic where we see internal struggle within Peter, when we see him fail, loose, suffer; because it makes the eventual triumph that much more spectacular.This movie single-handedly fixes whatever I saw was wrong with Tom Holland's Spiderman portrayal and elevated him to the stratosphere, leaving him off with a great prospect on what is to come. Not only that, but every character introduced is given enough moments to shine and takeaway something from this major event. Every single character that I wasn't quite sold on (from the principal ones I mean) have found a place to shine and show performances that enhances the movie, particularly Zendaya, Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina.It's one of the most daring MCU plots yet and it also manages to please all the cinematic Spider-Man fans at the same time. Whatever movie flaw it might have I have overlooked them as I do the rest of the MCU movies. These are not meant to revolutionise cinema, they are here to entertain, to provide interesting characters and stories and, sometimes even, to elevate and uplift us.IN CONCLUSION, I have no issues with this movie overall. I have some small nitpicks here and there, mostly to do with some of the comedy and side characters. But other than that, it sets out to do what it intended and, believe or not, serves as both conclusion to the MCU Spider-man and also transitioning movie to the stories to come. And I for one can not wait to see what's in store. If you are a Spider-Man fan you will love this movie because it does everything right, if you are a casual MCU fan you will be entertained and amused; and if you are a casual movie fan this movie might be a bit confusing. But then again, these are comicbook stories, I don't know what to tell you.","[['MCU Spider-Man'], ['some time', 'this experience', 'runtime'], ['Marvel', 'this movie', 'pandering', 'fan', 'service', 'messy plot', 'the main purpose', 'theme', 'the movie'], ['the first place', 'it.This movie', 'Tom Holland', 'Spider-Man', 'the wake', 'call'], ['Everyone', 'MCU', 'portrayal', 'Spider-Man', 'the character', 'the course', 'the portrayal'], ['Far', 'From Home', 'a step', 'the right direction', 'Homecoming', 'the pinnacle'], ['everyone', 'the movie', 'a story', 'perspective'], ['This movie'], ['the fact', 'all plot', 'this movie', 'liking'], ['a world', 'spionage', 'a bit', 'the fan', 'service', 'fan service', 'the story'], ['The multiversal', 'backdrop', 'redemption', 'realisation'], ['redemption'], ['MCU Spider-Man', 'movie', 'something', 'comicbook', 'conception', 'the character', 'the industry.Like', 'Dave Filoni', 'Star Wars', 'the emotional turmoil', 'Star Wars', 'the rest'], ['Spider-man', 'the swinging', 'the human element', 'Man', 'Spider-Man'], ['internal struggle', 'Peter', 'the eventual triumph', 'spectacular.This movie', 'fixes whatever', 'Tom Holland', 'Spiderman', 'portrayal', 'the stratosphere', 'a great prospect'], ['every character', 'something', 'this major event'], ['Every single character', 'a place', 'the movie', 'Zendaya', 'Willem Dafoe', 'Alfred Molina.It', 'MCU', 'the same time'], ['movie', 'flaw', 'the rest', 'MCU'], ['cinema', 'CONCLUSION', 'this movie', 'overall'], ['the comedy', 'side'], ['both conclusion', 'MCU Spider-man', 'movie'], ['store'], ['a Spider-Man fan', 'this movie', 'everything', 'MCU', 'fan', 'a casual movie', 'fan', 'this movie', 'a bit'], ['comicbook']]","[['MCU Spider-Man'], ['time', 'experience', 'runtime'], ['Marvel', 'movie', 'pandering', 'fan service', 'messy plot', 'main purpose and theme', 'movie'], ['possible filmmaking-related flaws', 'first place', 'it.This movie', 'fans', 'Tom Holland', 'Spider-Man', 'wake', 'call'], ['Everyone', 'MCU portrayal', 'Spider-Man', 'character', 'course', 'movies', 'portrayal'], ['Far From Home', 'step', 'direction from Homecoming', 'pinnacle'], ['screen writters and everyone', 'movie', 'story perspective'], ['movie', 'flaws and contrivances'], ['fact', 'plot devices', 'movie', 'liking'], ['world', 'political disputes and spionage', 'bit', 'fan service', 'fan service', 'services', 'story'], ['multiversal backdrop', 'things', 'redemption and realisation'], ['much spoilers', 'certain characters', 'emotional moments', 'characters', 'redemption', 'others', 'actions', 'consequences'], ['MCU Spider-Man movie', 'something', 'comicbook conception', 'character', 'industry.Like Dave Filoni', 'Star Wars', 'x-wings', 'lightsabers', 'aliens', 'familial conflicts', 'emotional turmoil', 'Star Wars', 'rest'], ['Spider-man', 'swinging', 'villains', 'crazy adventures', 'human element', 'Man in Spider-Man'], ['portions', 'struggle within Peter', 'eventual triumph', 'spectacular.This movie', 'fixes whatever', 'Tom Holland', 'Spiderman portrayal', 'stratosphere', 'great prospect'], ['character', 'enough moments', 'something', 'major event'], ['single character', 'principal ones', 'place', 'performances', 'movie', 'Zendaya', 'Willem Dafoe', 'Alfred Molina.It', 'MCU plots', 'cinematic Spider-Man fans', 'same time'], ['movie flaw', 'rest', 'MCU movies'], ['cinema', 'interesting characters and stories', 'us.IN CONCLUSION', 'issues', 'movie overall'], ['small nitpicks', 'comedy', 'side characters'], ['conclusion', 'MCU Spider-man', 'movie', 'stories'], ['store'], ['Spider-Man fan', 'movie', 'everything', 'MCU fan', 'movie fan', 'movie', 'bit'], ['comicbook stories']]"

178,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Spider-Man gets another masterpiece,"One of the best Spider-Man movies ever. Spider-Man: No Way Home is a fanservice galore fest done extremely well with jokes, emotion, and heart added to the mix. Not only giving closure to so much of Spider-Man's character, but also for the fans who always wondered how certain things would play out if they happened. This is a movie you need to witness.Picking up right off from Spider-Man: Far from Home, the film gets straight into action with dealing on consequences and trying to amend outcomes. In some ways similar to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, the film stays interesting from scene after scene and never misses a beat. Solid action set pieces and character interactions give the film a lot of fun things to work with, and by the end everyone was clapping and cheering.Without spoilers, No Way Home will please most people who are familiar with all the previous Spider-Man films. I got a little emotional and attached when certain characters popped up again and I definitely didn't feel the movie was a quick-in cashgrab at all. The performances were all really good, the special effects were top notch, and some of the music will be familiar to the fans.In the end, it proves Marvel can still pull off a really entertaining yet rewarding movie for Spider-Man fans. Some minor criticisms I have is there are a few contrivances and maybe some characters could have gotten a bit more screentime, but in the end I had such a blast with what the movie set out to do. No Way Home will probably be my favourite film of 2021. Try to go without spoilers though, it will be more satisfying.8.5/10.","[[], ['Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'a fanservice', 'galore', 'emotion', 'heart', 'the mix'], ['closure', 'Spider-Man', 'character'], ['a movie', 'Spider-Man', 'Far', 'Home', 'the film', 'action'], ['Spider-Verse', 'the film', 'scene', 'scene', 'a beat'], ['Solid action', 'character', 'the film', 'a lot', 'the end', 'everyone', 'cheering.Without', 'Way Home'], ['the movie', 'a quick-in cashgrab'], ['top notch', 'the music', 'the fans.In', 'the end', 'Marvel', 'movie'], ['a bit', 'the end', 'a blast', 'the movie'], ['Way Home', 'favourite film'], ['satisfying.8.5/10']]","[['Spider-Man movies'], ['Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'fanservice galore', 'jokes', 'emotion', 'heart', 'mix'], ['closure', 'Spider-Man', 'character', 'fans', 'certain things'], ['movie', 'Spider-Man', 'Far from Home', 'film', 'action', 'consequences', 'outcomes'], ['ways', 'Spider-Verse', 'film', 'scene after scene', 'beat'], ['Solid action', 'pieces', 'character interactions', 'film', 'lot', 'fun things', 'end everyone', 'cheering.Without spoilers', 'Way Home', 'people', 'previous Spider-Man films'], ['certain characters', 'movie', 'quick-in cashgrab'], ['performances', 'special effects', 'top notch', 'music', 'fans.In', 'end', 'Marvel', 'movie', 'Spider-Man fans'], ['minor criticisms', 'few contrivances', 'characters', 'bit', 'end', 'blast', 'movie'], ['Way Home', 'favourite film'], ['spoilers', 'satisfying.8.5/10']]"

To much moral cliches are included which will really bore you.All in all, apart from the computer work, it's a below average teenage film.

181,Spider-Man: No Way Home,A lot of brilliance to take in,"The anticipation for the movie was second to only Avengers: Endgame. So naturally I was expecting big things, and trust me, it didn't disappoint.I found myself, throughout the film and the days after watching it, trying and failing to pin my thoughts down and give it a score out of 10. This is likely due to the amalgamation of so many previous characters, spanning from 2002-2021 through multiple movies and franchises. This was not a negative, but rather something to be very, very excited about and nervous of how it would be handled. I was scared of a clear villain not being established, however Willem Defoe's Green Goblin was expertly presented as 'the baddie'. Peter is haunted by him after the death of Aunt May, and his iconic, almost Joker-esque laugh gave him a real villainous tone.I can't write a spoilers review without talking about the other Spider-men. The relationship between the three Peter's is everything every Spider-man fan has ever wanted, from their hilarious conversations about web shooters and aliens to their instant connection over the loss of their loved ones. I could not help but laugh at the simplicity yet complication of it all, it's just three different Peter's, yet 20 years in the making. A side note, does this mean that the MCU started in 2002?The basic plot for this film is something new for Spider-man. And while it works very well, it did keep me asking questions about Doctor Strange's abilities. Could he have made everyone forget about the clip that Mysterio made instead of listening to Peter's suggestion? Surely he's smart enough to know that Peter wouldn't want everyone to forget? This line of logic is the main fault with this film. Specifically towards the end when every universe is about to raid Peter's and he suggests to just recast the original spell. Films in which the main character suddenly comes up with some form of solution at the end undermines the entire movie.Tom Holland takes the role of Spider-man in a different way than Andrew Garfield or Tobey Maguire did. Throughout his first trilogy, he doesn't ""change"" into Spider-man, he essentially stays as Peter even when he's in the suit. This helped bring Peter alive and give us a much more realistic representation of the character. He also doesn't have as much of a problem of balancing lives like Maguire did, or a problem with his Uncle Ben for that matter (Who isn't even mentioned by Holland's Parker after Maguire's Parker explains how he lost him). His adorable geekiness and lovable lightheartedness make this film not only a brilliant Spider-man movie, but a brilliant Peter Parker movie too.","[['The anticipation', 'the movie', 'Endgame'], ['the film', 'a score'], ['the amalgamation'], ['something'], ['a clear villain', 'Willem Defoe', 'Green Goblin', ""'the baddie""], ['Peter', 'the death', 'Aunt May', 'iconic', 'Joker-esque', 'laugh', 'a real villainous tone.I', 'Spider-men'], ['The relationship', 'Peter', 'everything', 'every Spider-man fan', 'web', 'instant connection', 'the loss'], ['the simplicity', 'complication', 'Peter', 'the making'], ['A side', 'note', 'this mean', 'MCU', 'The basic plot', 'this film', 'something', 'Spider-man'], ['Doctor Strange'], ['everyone', 'forget', 'the clip', 'Mysterio', 'Peter', 'suggestion'], ['Peter', 'everyone'], ['This line', 'logic', 'the main fault', 'this film'], ['the end', 'every universe', 'Peter', 'the original spell'], ['the main character', 'some form', 'solution', 'the end', 'the entire movie.Tom', 'Holland', 'the role', 'Spider-man', 'a different way', 'Andrew Garfield', 'Tobey Maguire'], ['first trilogy', 'Spider-man', 'Peter', 'the suit'], ['Peter', 'realistic representation', 'the character'], ['a problem', 'Maguire', 'a problem', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'that matter', 'Holland', 'Parker', 'Maguire', 'Parker'], ['adorable geekiness', 'lovable lightheartedness', 'this film', 'a brilliant Spider-man movie', 'Peter Parker', 'movie']]","[['anticipation', 'movie', 'only Avengers', 'Endgame'], ['big things', 'film', 'days', 'thoughts', 'score'], ['amalgamation', 'many previous characters', 'multiple movies and franchises'], ['something'], ['clear villain', 'Willem Defoe', 'Green Goblin', ""'the baddie""], ['Peter', 'death of Aunt May', 'iconic', 'Joker-esque laugh', 'real villainous tone.I', 'spoilers', 'other Spider-men'], ['relationship', 'Peter', 'everything', 'Spider-man fan', 'conversations about web shooters', 'aliens', 'instant connection', 'loss', 'loved ones'], ['simplicity', 'complication', 'different Peter', 'years', 'making'], ['side note', 'mean', 'MCU', 'basic plot', 'film', 'something', 'Spider-man'], ['questions about Doctor Strange', 'abilities'], ['everyone forget', 'clip', 'Mysterio', 'Peter', 'suggestion'], ['Peter', 'everyone'], ['line of logic', 'main fault', 'film'], ['end', 'universe', 'Peter', 'original spell'], ['Films', 'main character', 'form of solution', 'end', 'movie.Tom Holland', 'role of Spider-man', 'way than Andrew Garfield', 'Tobey Maguire'], ['first trilogy', 'Spider-man', 'Peter', 'suit'], ['Peter', 'realistic representation', 'character'], ['problem', 'lives like Maguire', 'problem', 'Uncle Ben', 'matter', 'Holland', 'Parker after Maguire', 'Parker'], ['adorable geekiness', 'lovable lightheartedness', 'film', 'brilliant Spider-man movie', 'Peter Parker movie']]"

The whole plot was a flop to be honest, I can't understand why they would even go for it. I mean the idea was great but the execution was terrible esp the introduction of the two spideys. And how in the world did Spidey outsmart Dr Strange in his own world, but he couldn't handle a mere human like Green Goblin?!

183,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Entertaining.....but something felt missing.,"Don't get me wrong, i enjoyed this movie. Although it mainly just looked like a cameo showcase with some connective plot. Even the lines were cameo'd in certain areas to possibly trigger nostalgia more.I sort of liked the story and get what they were trying to do, but it seemed too complicated to be executed with a clean narrative. I don't like how Doctor Strange was down powered by Peter Parker, i know Peter is a smart nerdy kid with powers but it destroyed the whole mystic arts master vibe that we love from Strange. Maybe it's just me that felt that way.Like i said i get the idea but it was too quick of an execution. I guess development would cause the movie to be 5 hours long. It was a little cringy in areas where i noticed plot holes just so they could speed up the story and not give proper explanations. It was just too large of an idea to crush into a 2+ hour movie and make sense.My answer is enjoy the movie through nostalgia and entertainment, don't look for clean story because instead the movie looked like a brag on what Disney can accomplish when making deals with other studios.

190,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Great experience but do not look too much into it...,"On the surface Spider-Man: No Way Home is highly entertaining, funny and with some heartfelt moments and all contributes to a satisfying view. It is great too see again some old villains and in general there is a lot of fan service but is done well and it's not annoying. The movie is also able to trigger people reactions and if you watch this movie in a passionate theatre the experience will be great because you can hear the sounds of the people around you, and it was something that I didn't experience since the pandemic has started and it was nice. You'll probably walk out from the viewing with very positive vibes and with high levels of satisfaction. BUT if you start think about it with a more critical view the magic will vanish because nothing makes sense. The premise is so stupid and the movie happens because Peter had suddenly become retarded, and not only him. Things happen because we will never know (like the reason for the return of the villains, the movie tries to give an explanation but in reality doesn't). And realistically what is the probability that between an infinite number of universes could happen exactly what has happened in the movie? How fortunate we were! And also the finale (that is very very satisfying and emotional) comes from a sudden change of the rules established previously in the movie. And so you can see that everything is only a pretext to please fans but without a real structure or a good premise behind it. The plot is useful only for the fan service. And if on one hand it is what has made my watching an experience, it is something that has to be noted. And so I am divided between my fan nature that has liked this movie and my rational and objective nature that dislikes it because of the nonsense of the plot. And so in conclusion what I can say is: go watch it for the experience without expecting a good movie, only a collection of cool scenes.","[['the surface', 'Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'some heartfelt', 'a satisfying view'], ['a lot', 'fan', 'service'], ['The movie', 'this movie', 'a passionate', 'the experience', 'something', 'the pandemic'], ['satisfaction'], ['BUT', 'critical view', 'the magic', 'nothing', 'sense'], ['The premise', 'the movie', 'Peter'], ['the reason', 'the return', 'the movie', 'an explanation', 'reality'], ['the probability', 'an infinite number', 'the movie'], [], ['the finale', 'a sudden change', 'the movie'], ['everything', 'a pretext', 'a real structure', 'a good premise'], ['The plot', 'the fan', 'service'], ['hand', 'an experience', 'something'], ['fan', 'nature', 'this movie', 'objective nature', 'the nonsense', 'the plot'], ['conclusion', 'the experience', 'a good movie', 'a collection']]","[['surface Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'heartfelt moments', 'contributes', 'satisfying view'], ['old villains', 'lot of fan service'], ['movie', 'people reactions', 'movie', 'passionate', 'experience', 'sounds', 'people', 'something', 'pandemic'], ['positive vibes', 'levels of satisfaction'], ['BUT', 'critical view', 'magic', 'nothing', 'sense'], ['premise', 'movie', 'Peter'], ['Things', 'reason', 'return', 'villains', 'movie', 'explanation', 'reality'], ['probability', 'number of universes', 'movie'], [], ['finale', 'sudden change', 'rules', 'movie'], ['everything', 'pretext', 'fans', 'real structure', 'good premise'], ['plot', 'fan service'], ['hand', 'experience', 'something'], ['fan nature', 'movie', 'objective nature', 'nonsense', 'plot'], ['conclusion', 'experience', 'good movie', 'collection', 'cool scenes']]"

193,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Spider-Man: Consolidation,"This film was entertaining enough. I liked the acting, the little gems, the sheer hubris of the story. However, it was for all intents and purposes, a universe consolidation move (before they break it all again in Multiverse of Madness). It's one of those reset stories, but one that manages to unite previous resets, which makes it the resettiest of them all. It is there to basically answer all the comic geek questions about how could so many films and reboots and stories exist in the same MCU and open the door to the future.There were no real new characters, some were explained away, some where killed off and new concepts of the incoming threats hinted at. One end-credits scene winked towards a Venom recrossing, while the second was basically a trailer for the next Doctor Strange film, not a ""scene"".So there is a difference between the typical Marvel cinematic universe film and this one: the villain(s) are weak and unfocused while the plot, however entertaining, just a background to the goal of the film: to stabilize the canon and prepare for the new Doctor Strange movie. This does mean the Strangeverse will grow and possibly be amazingly fun, but also that I don't see the Avengers going anywhere for a long while, except maybe TV series.In conclusion: for the fans of the Marvel stories and the faithful viewers of movies and series in that universe, this is a big nice bonus, a step on a promising ladder of new content. However as a standalone film it has limited value. It is a good film, and probably a necessary one, but its storytelling will not blow your mind in any way.","[['This film'], ['the acting', 'the sheer', 'hubris', 'the story'], ['a universe consolidation', 'move', 'Multiverse', 'Madness'], ['the resettiest'], ['MCU', 'the door', 'the incoming'], ['end-credits scene', 'Venom', 'recrossing', 'the second', 'a trailer', 'Doctor Strange', 'film', 'scene', '.So', 'a difference', 'Marvel', 'cinematic universe', 'film', 'this one', 'the villain', 's', 'the plot', 'a background', 'the goal', 'the film', 'the canon', 'Doctor Strange', 'movie'], ['Strangeverse', 'a long while', 'TV', 'series.In conclusion', 'Marvel', 'series', 'that universe', 'a big nice bonus', 'a step', 'a promising ladder', 'new content'], ['a standalone', 'film', 'value'], ['a good film', 'storytelling', 'mind', 'any way']]","[['film'], ['acting', 'little gems', 'sheer hubris', 'story'], ['intents and purposes', 'consolidation move', 'Multiverse of Madness'], ['reset stories', 'previous resets', 'resettiest'], ['comic geek questions', 'many films and reboots', 'stories', 'same MCU', 'door', 'future.There', 'real new characters', 'new concepts', 'incoming threats'], ['end-credits scene', 'Venom recrossing', 'second', 'trailer', 'Doctor Strange film', 'scene', '.So', 'difference', 'typical Marvel', 'universe film', 'one', 'villain', 's', 'plot', 'background', 'goal', 'film', 'canon', 'Doctor Strange movie'], ['Strangeverse', 'Avengers', 'long while', 'TV', 'series.In conclusion', 'fans', 'Marvel stories', 'viewers of movies', 'series', 'universe', 'big nice bonus', 'step', 'promising ladder', 'new content'], ['standalone film', 'value'], ['good film', 'storytelling', 'mind', 'way']]"
194,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Great Escapist fun and entertaining,"My Review - Spider-Man : No Way Home
My Rating 8/ 10I've never seen a queue like this one at our local regional Blue Mountains Cinema so it looks like this new Spider-Man movie will be a Box Office bonanza . It certainly needs to be as the estimated Production Budget was an obscene $200 million USDollars .I rated the previous Spider-Man: Far From Home a very respectable 8/10 as I enjoyed it immensely.This movie is the sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), and is the 27th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe
Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) takes place directly after the events of Spider-Man: Far from Home (2019). Meaning that it takes place in the Spring/Fall of 2024.With Spider-Man's identity now revealed, Peter asks Doctor Strange for help. When a spell goes wrong, dangerous foes from other worlds start to appear, forcing Peter to discover what it truly means to be Spider-Man.The ingredient I enjoy most in this Marvel franchise and there's a lot of comic book humour in Spider-Man or as I think this one should really be titled Spider-Men. No spoilers but I enjoyed the second half of this long movie more than the first especially when Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire form the formidable trio of Arachnids.It's amazing to me where original quotes from Spider-Man show up and are used by other cultural iconic personalities I didn't realise that Ru Paul's often used quote ""With great power comes great responsibility, which Queen 👑 have you chosen to get the CHOPPED? Is a proverb popularized by the Spider-Man comic books written by Stan Lee and published by Marvel Comics
Of course the CGI effects are the best State of the Art but I think it's the great ensemble cast that makes these films so entertaining including the Actor of the moment Benedict Cumberbatch as the Wizard Dr Stange . I particularly enjoyed Zendayer as Peter Parker's girlfriend she has some great moments with Tom Holland (Spider-Man) and she's delightfully natural.Tom Holland helped to save this movie from cancellation by forcing renegotiations between Sony and Disney. Under the terms of the new deal, not only does Spider-Man: No Way Home still take place within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), but Spider-man can also appear in future MCU movies, as well as Sony's own Spider-Man franchise.If Sci Fi Action is your favourite movie genre you'll probably rate this latest Marvel movie higher than my quite high 8/10 Rating but I thought it a bit dull in parts and a tad too long 20minutes longer than Spider-Man : Far from Home which I enjoyed more and that movie only cost a mere $140 million estimated budget to make.Great Escapism Movie - Well done.","[['Review', 'Spider-Man', 'Way Home My', 'a queue', 'Blue Mountains Cinema', 'this new Spider-Man movie', 'Box Office', 'bonanza'], ['Production Budget', 'USDollars .I', 'the previous Spider-Man', 'Far', 'From Home', 'immensely.This movie', 'the sequel', 'Spider-Man', 'Homecoming', 'Far', 'Home', 'the 27th film', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe', 'Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'place', 'Spider-Man', 'Far', 'Home'], ['place', 'Spring/Fall', 'Spider-Man', 'identity', 'Peter', 'Doctor Strange', 'help'], ['a spell', 'Peter', 'Spider-Man.The ingredient', 'Marvel', 'franchise', 'a lot', 'comic book', 'humour', 'Spider-Man', 'Spider-Men'], ['the second half', 'this long movie', 'Andrew Garfield', 'Tobey Maguire', 'the formidable trio', 'Arachnids.It', 'amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'Ru Paul', 'great power', 'great responsibility', 'Queen 👑', 'CHOPPED'], ['a proverb', 'Spider-Man', 'Stan Lee', 'Marvel Comics', 'course', 'CGI', 'State', 'Art', 'the great ensemble cast', 'the Actor', 'the moment', 'Benedict Cumberbatch', 'Wizard Dr Stange'], ['Zendayer', 'Peter Parker', 'girlfriend', 'Tom Holland', 'Spider-Man', 'Holland', 'this movie', 'cancellation', 'Sony', 'Disney'], ['the new deal', 'Way Home', 'place', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe', 'MCU', 'Spider-man', 'MCU', 'Sony', 'own Spider-Man franchise.If', 'Sci Fi Action', 'favourite movie', 'genre', 'rate', 'Marvel movie', 'a bit', 'Spider-Man', 'Far', 'Home', 'movie', 'budget', 'Escapism Movie']]","[['Review', 'Spider-Man', 'Way Home My', 'queue', 'Blue Mountains Cinema', 'new Spider-Man movie', 'Box Office bonanza'], ['Production Budget', 'USDollars .I', 'previous Spider-Man', 'Far From Home', 'immensely.This movie', 'sequel', 'Spider-Man', 'Homecoming', 'Far From Home', '27th film', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'place', 'events of Spider-Man', 'Far from Home'], ['place', 'Spring/Fall', 'Spider-Man', 'identity', 'Peter', 'Doctor Strange', 'help'], ['spell', 'dangerous foes', 'other worlds', 'Peter', 'Spider-Man.The ingredient', 'Marvel franchise', 'lot', 'book humour', 'Spider-Man', 'Spider-Men'], ['spoilers', 'second half', 'long movie', 'Andrew Garfield', 'Tobey Maguire', 'trio of Arachnids.It', 'amazing', 'quotes from Spider-Man', 'other cultural iconic personalities', 'Ru Paul', 'great power', 'great responsibility', 'Queen 👑', 'CHOPPED'], ['proverb', 'Spider-Man', 'comic books', 'Stan Lee', 'Marvel Comics', 'course', 'CGI effects', 'State', 'Art', 'great ensemble cast', 'films', 'Actor', 'moment Benedict Cumberbatch', 'Wizard Dr Stange'], ['Zendayer as Peter Parker', 'girlfriend', 'moments with Tom Holland', 'Spider-Man', 'natural.Tom Holland', 'movie from cancellation', 'renegotiations between Sony', 'Disney'], ['terms', 'new deal', 'Way Home', 'place', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe', 'MCU', 'Spider-man', 'MCU movies', 'Sony', 'franchise.If Sci Fi Action', 'movie genre', 'rate', 'Marvel movie', 'bit', 'parts', 'Spider-Man', 'Far from Home', 'movie', 'budget', 'Escapism Movie']]"

201,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Marvel series converted into a Movie special,"In summary this movie was well received and for good reason because it's a solid good movie. With that being said it wasn't great and it wasn't the best spiderman movie. It heavily relied on nostalgia to carry the plot and development and while I can appreciate it all it didn't exactly climax as I was hoping for. Felt like the marvel series as of late just compiled into a movie instead of episodes.Tom holland uses up the last of his awkward teen spiderman attitude in a overdue effort for his character to finally start truly evolving. Yet it comes pretty slow over the course of this film. Additionally, the main conflicts in this movie basically are all spidermans faults when you really think about it which makes it even less of a plot arch due to the circular reasoning behind the movie.Nostalgically it carries the film for obvious reasons and while I loved what happens I feel like it wasn't as wholesome as I expected it to be.. I guess I just got a high expectation from all the great feedback of the film.There were some glaring issues with the plots reasoning and motivations but I get it. Overlooking some of those things it felt like this film was just a filler marvel movie to set up for the next phase and it showed up in its quality. Felt more like a movie special for tom holland instead of a side series that marvel did for loki, wandavision, wintersoldier, and hawkeye.

202,Spider-Man: No Way Home,"It's fun, full of chuckles and very meta. BUT a little perspective please.","As I've said in some of my past reviews, some people only know two ratings, either a 1 or a 10.When every review, I see, is putting out a 10/10, perhaps one should step back and get some perspective. This isn't The Godfather!If you've enjoyed Holland's other outings, you will enjoy this.The trailer gives you clues as to what to expect AND I would strongly suggest you watch all previous Spider-Man films (the Sam Raimi versions and the ""amazing Spider-Man"" versions).It'll help.First of, the film is certainly fun and funny. Lot's of jokes and in jokes.There is some lag though. There is whole 10 minute scene in Happy's apartment that plods a little but then we're back to it.I think of all the previous Spider-Man relationships, Hollands and Zendya's is the most believable (well that may well be as they are a couple in real life).The film is sort of like a sweet nostalgia trip.There are a few questions, we as the audience needed answering and which are even asked in the film, but the answers are never given. Despite that, it does a very good job of resolving a lot and putting to bed a number of issues from past films.I have said nothing of the plot nor do I intend to.The reason you are reading this review is either you want to understand why I didn't give it a 10/10 and therefore why am I not fanboying over it or you genuinely want to know whether it's worth seeing in the cinema.The answer to the first question is that it's a very good film but it won't make my top 10 of all time. There is a lot thrown at this and a lot of it sticks but some of it doesn't quite hit the mark.The answer to the second question is well it depends on the cinema.My advise is that you go see it a big screen, good seating, social distanced cinema. You want that cinematic experience.I went to an multiplex with people sitting next to each other in a reasonably packed theatre with a screen which, frankly by today's standard, was bog standard to small (which surprised me considering the calibre of film being shown),So yeah, go see it (especially if you've seen all the previous ones) but on a grand big old screen cinema with comfortable seating.Enjoy.","[['every review', 'some perspective'], ['Godfather', 'Holland', 'this.The trailer', 'AND', 'Sam Raimi', 'amazing Spider-Man', 'the film'], ['Lot', 'jokes.There', 'some lag'], ['minute scene', 'Happy', 'apartment', 'think', 'Hollands', 'Zendya', 'a couple', 'real life', '.The', 'film', 'sort', 'a sweet nostalgia', 'the audience', 'answering', 'the film'], ['good job', 'a lot', 'a number', 'past films.I', 'nothing', 'the plot', 'to.The reason', 'this review', 'the cinema.The', 'answer', 'the first question', 'good film', 'all time'], ['a lot', 'a lot', 'the mark.The', 'answer', 'the second question', 'the cinema.My', 'advise', 'a big screen', 'good seating', 'cinema'], ['cinematic experience.I', 'an multiplex', 'theatre', 'a screen', 'today', 'standard', 'bog standard', 'the calibre', 'film', 'So', 'a grand big old screen', 'cinema', 'comfortable seating.Enjoy']]","[['past reviews', 'people', 'ratings', 'review', 'perspective'], ['Godfather', 'Holland', 'other outings', 'this.The trailer', 'clues', 'AND', 'previous Spider-Man films', 'Sam Raimi versions', 'amazing Spider-Man', 'versions', 'film'], ['Lot', 'jokes', 'jokes.There', 'lag'], ['scene in Happy', 'apartment', 'think', 'previous Spider-Man relationships', 'Hollands and Zendya', 'couple', 'real life', '.The film', 'sort', 'sweet nostalgia', 'few questions', 'audience', 'answering', 'film', 'answers'], ['good job', 'lot', 'number of issues', 'past films.I', 'nothing', 'plot', 'to.The reason', 'review', 'cinema.The answer', 'first question', 'good film', 'time'], ['lot', 'lot', 'mark.The answer', 'second question', 'cinema.My advise', 'big screen', 'good seating', 'cinema'], ['cinematic experience.I', 'multiplex with people', 'theatre', 'screen', 'today', 'standard', 'bog standard', 'calibre of film', 'So', 'previous ones', 'screen cinema', 'comfortable seating.Enjoy']]"
203,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Marvel continue their hot streak of epic blockbusters,"Spider-Man: No Way Home is the latest blockbuster to arrive from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Spider-man's identity is revealed to be Peter Parker, whose life gets turned upside down, and he is faced with his greatest challenge yet.No Way Home is a great superhero film filled with amazing action, heart-wrenching emotional scenes, and incredible surprises. If you have watched Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame you will see many similarities. Both in the sheer scope of the film and in the epic nature in which it unfolds. In my theater the audience erupted several times, cheering and applauding.The action is hard-hitting and significantly more violent than previous Spider-Man movies from Marvel which adds something new and great to this film. The story is also great which both makes for an amazing movie and it paves the way for plenty of great movies to come. The movie also features the best performance from Tom Holland yet. He is finally coming into his own as Spider-Man and it is honestly amazing to see.Go see this movie immediately. Do your best not to get spoiled and see it in the cinema. You won't be disappointed. Spider-Man: No Way Home is the greatest Spider-Man movie I've ever seen and one of the best Marvel movies I've ever seen as well. Overall a great film and I can't wait to see where the Marvel Cinematic Universe goes next.","[['Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'blockbuster', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe'], ['Spider-man', 'identity', 'Peter Parker', 'life', 'challenge', 'yet.No', 'Way Home', 'a great superhero', 'film', 'amazing action'], ['Infinity War', 'Endgame'], ['the sheer', 'scope', 'the film', 'the epic nature'], ['theater', 'the audience', 'applauding.The action', 'Marvel', 'something', 'this film'], ['The story', 'an amazing movie', 'the way', 'plenty'], ['The movie', 'performance', 'Tom Holland'], ['Spider-Man', 'this movie'], ['the cinema'], [], ['Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'Spider-Man movie'], ['a great film', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe']]","[['Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'blockbuster', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe'], ['Spider-man', 'identity', 'Peter Parker', 'life', 'challenge yet.No Way Home', 'superhero film', 'amazing action', 'heart-wrenching emotional scenes', 'incredible surprises'], ['Avengers', 'Infinity War', 'Avengers', 'Endgame', 'many similarities'], ['sheer scope', 'film', 'epic nature'], ['theater', 'audience', 'several times', 'applauding.The action', 'movies from Marvel', 'something', 'film'], ['story', 'amazing movie', 'way for plenty', 'great movies'], ['movie', 'performance from Tom Holland'], ['Spider-Man', 'movie'], ['cinema'], [], ['Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'Spider-Man movie', 'Marvel movies'], ['great film', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe']]"

Tobey even acting as the senior most and guiding Andrew through relationships and the best part Tobey putting himself between Tom and goblin to prevent Tom from running into the path of vengeance. I've seen the movie twice in 12 hours but couldn't shake the emotions I felt for the three of them the first time.

209,Spider-Man: No Way Home,"""The multiverse is a concept of which we know frighteningly little.""","Easily the most anticipated and theorised comic book film since Avengers: Endgame. Spider-Man: No Way Home is set directly after the end of Far From Home. With Spider-Man's (Tom Holland) identity now revealed, Peter asks Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for help. When the spell goes wrong, dangerous foes from other worlds start to appear.It was always going to be difficult for this to live up to the myriad of potential expectations that had built up in mine and millions of others heads after the first trailer released back in August. Luckily throughout its duration No Way Home excels at fan pleasing moments and truly giving Peter monumental stakes and potential consequences. However it is undeniably overstuffed and choppy, as well as for me personally a lot of the MCU'isms not always particularly gelling well with the returning villains.I will be keeping the plot details vague, but for those who had expectations and ideas of what the film might be, it probably is pretty much what you expect. The opening act ripple effect of Peter's identity being revealed, with he, MJ and Ned being turned down by colleges and constant harassment sets the stage well and understandably Peter's desperation for Doctor Strange to fix it. From there the rogues gallery pour through and it's up to Peter to stop them.Here is where some of my favourite aspects of the film are, as well as my irritations. It's undeniably great seeing these characters return to the big screen, and throughout the second act it is uniquely executed and delivers some satisfying interactions between the foes (though some of their motivations could have been a bit more fleshed out), as well as time to breathe. However it is once again the abundance of joke attempts and alterations to a couple of the characters that just make some of the interactions feel awkward and cringe inducing.Doc Ock's bridge battle is a standout return and the choreography, sound design and score all intertwine nicely. Holland wasn't lying about this being a darker and more violent entry into the franchise, with the first Goblin brawl being the film's highlight, alongside the jaw-dropping visual spectacle of the mirror dimension duel. The final action set piece is pure spectacle and grin inducingly fun, it's just a shame that yet again it's another CGI heavy sequence set at night, so it's frequently hard to see what's going on at certain points.This is probably Holland's best Spider-Man performance as he really has some emotional heavy lifting to do, as well as keeping the quips and enthusiasm fresh. Willem Dafoe absolutely steals the film. He's still got all of it: the grin, the laugh, the expressions and genuine menace. Molina as well, brilliantly capturing the commanding intelligence and personality of Doc Ock and Jamie Foxx is far better suited in this iteration of Electro. Benedict Cumberbatch adds a layer of bitterness and snark to Strange, yet keeps his core values and dedication to help in check.Spider-Man: No Way Home may just be the film many fans of dreamed of. Unfortunately for me, whilst it still delivered a lot of what I wanted, I can't help but feel a bit disappointed. Dafoe & Molina prove once again why Spider-Man 1 & 2 will never be topped, the increased personal stakes for Peter are welcome and I'm still partially in awe that the film actually happened. However the leering presence of now extremely familiar and annoying MCU traits and tropes, certain character interactions and an overstuffed storyline do hold it back.","[['theorised comic book', 'film', 'Endgame'], ['Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'the end', 'Far From Home'], ['Spider-Man', 'Tom Holland', 'identity', 'Peter', 'Doctor Strange', 'Benedict Cumberbatch', 'help'], ['the spell', 'the myriad', 'mine', 'the first trailer', 'August'], ['duration', 'Way Home', 'fan', 'Peter'], ['a lot', ""MCU'isms"", 'villains.I', 'the plot', 'the film'], ['The opening', 'act', 'ripple effect', 'Peter', 'identity', 'MJ', 'Ned', 'constant harassment', 'the stage', 'Peter', 'desperation', 'Doctor Strange'], ['Peter', 'them.Here', 'the film'], ['the big screen', 'the second act', 'time'], ['the abundance', 'joke', 'a couple', 'Ock', 'bridge', 'battle', 'a standout return', 'the choreography', 'sound design', 'score'], ['Holland', 'a darker', 'violent entry', 'the franchise', 'Goblin', 'brawl', 'the film', 'highlight', 'the jaw-dropping visual spectacle', 'the mirror', 'dimension', 'duel'], ['The final action', 'piece', 'pure spectacle', 'grin', 'a shame', 'CGI', 'heavy sequence', 'night', 'certain points.This', 'Holland', 'Spider-Man performance', 'some emotional heavy lifting', 'enthusiasm', 'fresh'], ['Willem Dafoe', 'the film'], ['the grin', 'the laugh', 'genuine menace'], ['Molina', 'the commanding intelligence', 'personality', 'Doc Ock', 'Jamie Foxx', 'this iteration', 'Electro'], ['Benedict Cumberbatch', 'a layer', 'bitterness', 'snark', 'Strange', 'core', 'dedication', 'check.Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'the film', 'dreamed'], ['a lot', 'a bit'], ['Dafoe', 'Molina', 'Spider-Man', 'Peter', 'awe', 'the film'], ['presence', 'MCU', 'certain character', 'an overstuffed storyline']]","[['book film', 'Avengers', 'Endgame'], ['Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'end of Far From Home'], ['Spider-Man', 'Tom Holland', 'identity', 'Peter', 'Doctor Strange', 'Benedict Cumberbatch', 'help'], ['spell', 'dangerous foes', 'other worlds', 'myriad', 'potential expectations', 'mine', 'millions of others heads', 'first trailer', 'August'], ['duration', 'Way Home excels', 'fan', 'moments', 'Peter', 'monumental stakes', 'potential consequences'], ['undeniably overstuffed', 'lot', ""MCU'isms"", 'villains.I', 'plot details', 'expectations and ideas', 'film'], ['opening act', 'effect of Peter', 'identity', 'MJ and Ned', 'colleges', 'constant harassment', 'stage', 'Peter', 'desperation for Doctor Strange'], ['rogues', 'Peter', 'them.Here', 'favourite aspects', 'film', 'irritations'], ['characters', 'big screen', 'second act', 'delivers', 'interactions', 'foes', 'motivations', 'time'], ['abundance of joke attempts', 'alterations', 'couple', 'characters', 'interactions', 'inducing.Doc Ock', 'bridge battle', 'standout return', 'choreography', 'sound design and score'], ['Holland', 'darker', 'violent entry', 'franchise', 'Goblin brawl', 'film', 'highlight', 'jaw-dropping visual spectacle', 'mirror dimension duel'], ['final action', 'piece', 'pure spectacle and grin', 'shame', 'CGI', 'heavy sequence', 'night', 'certain points.This', 'Holland', 'Spider-Man performance', 'emotional heavy lifting', 'quips', 'enthusiasm fresh'], ['Willem Dafoe', 'film'], ['grin', 'laugh', 'expressions', 'genuine menace'], ['Molina', 'commanding intelligence', 'personality of Doc Ock', 'Jamie Foxx', 'iteration of Electro'], ['Benedict Cumberbatch', 'layer of bitterness', 'snark', 'Strange', 'core values', 'dedication', 'check.Spider-Man', 'Way Home', 'film', 'fans of dreamed'], ['lot', 'bit'], ['Dafoe & Molina', 'Spider-Man', 'stakes for Peter', 'awe', 'film'], ['presence', 'MCU traits', 'tropes', 'character interactions', 'overstuffed storyline']]"

I didn't think I'd hate or dislike it as much, but at the same time, I wasn't wowed either despite the returns of the original characters from the other & Universes!The film picks up exactly from where the last Spider-Man Film left off!

While weird it somehow worked just about & the story wasn't too bad either!However, the film is 2hrs & 15mins too long! It drags there's scenes which are too dumb to be in the film which take away from the seriousness! While I liked the return of the original Spider-Mans it felt dumb & weird to some extend & that it wasn't its own film, like with the previous 2 films...!Overall, it's a good film to an extent, but it's not amazing! 6/10!","[['a screening', 'this tonight'], ['the same time', 'The film', 'Film'], ['Peter Parker', 'murder', 'name', 'college', 'mate', 'girlfriend', 'the help', 'Doctor Strange', 'the world', 'the same college'], ['something', 'the spell', 'world', 'Villains', 'Peters', 'Peter', 'the film', 'Tom Hollands Spider-Man', 'dumb goofiness', 'long runtime', 'dragged comedic', 'the seriousness', 'this film', 'Tobey McGuire', 'Spider-Man', 'Andrew Garfield', 'Spider-Man'], ['the story', 'the film'], ['the film', 'the seriousness'], ['the return', 'weird', 'some extend', 'own film', 'a good film', 'an extent'], []]","[['screening', 'tonight'], ['same time', 'returns', 'original characters', 'film', 'last Spider-Man Film'], ['Peter Parker', 'murder', 'name', 'college', 'mate & girlfriend', 'help of Doctor Strange', 'world', 'same college'], ['something', 'spell', 'other universes', 'other franchises', 'world', 'original Villains', 'other Peters', 'villains', 'Peter', 'other ideas', 'film', 'same issues', 'films of Tom Hollands Spider-Man', 'characters', 'originals', 'dumb goofiness', 'other characters', 'sub plots/characters', 'long runtime', 'comedic scenes', 'seriousness', 'film', 'old characters', 'actors from Tobey McGuire', 'Spider-Man', 'Andrew Garfield Spider-Man'], ['story', 'film'], ['scenes', 'film', 'seriousness'], ['return', 'original Spider-Mans', 'weird', 'extend', 'own film', 'films', 'good film', 'extent'], []]"

224,Spider-Man: No Way Home,a terrible blockbuster,"Today I'm going to talk about Marvel's latest effort, the latest film from the MCU Spiderman: No Way Home, for the direction of John Watts.This film was a mediatic phenomenon, as we all know, there were high expectations and have been made a lot of assumptions by Marvel fans and not only. I think this hype is good for cinema in general but a terrible film like this isn't worth for all this hype, the others lose something because everyone have been to the cinema only for a film that I don't feel like call as such.The direction seems not to exist and unfortunately, I'm not kidding, everything is made by the computer and you don't understand anything. There isn't photography or cinematography, anything, not even a shot that you could remind, nothing remains in mind except the thought about the money you have spent for buying a ticket and watching this total idiocy.The previable plot has a lot of plot twist that do not add anything to the plot which is predictable, like the 90% of the events, so the story is a total idiocy.It seems like the people who written this film, which is not a real film, did not have any ideas and invented a mess for end in something obvious. The concept in the beginning is useless, so if I want to remove what is useless this film would last for like 15 mins.The screenwriting isn't decent, to add, with a lot of mandatory rules broken with narrative elements that are equal to all and not innovative, and all this fix me a question in mind: How did they write this film?The principal character are: Tom Holland's Peter Parker/Spiderman, Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange and the ones from the old Spiderman's films.Tom Holland's Spiderman isn't interesting because is like a dumb boy with stupid ideas that don't make sense, he wants to be a hero but he is incapable, it comes out badly. He is kid that acts in an unwatchable way, in fact he has two expressions; one when he's happy and the other one when he is sad, when he cries, he is ridicules and not credible.In conclusion his acting was cringe.Moreover, this Doctor Strange of Benedict Cumberbatch is like a child in fact he has behaviors truly questionable; he is stupid and the symbol of the terrible fanservice, he made thing that the old Doctor Strange would never do, he can't even do spells in the right way, c'mon. So, for resume everything in one word, he is an idiot.Thanks, this film, they demonstrated that the actors of the Sam Raimi's trilogy are the best, because they are such great actors and they work perfectly, from fantastic William Dafoe's Goblin to wonderful Otto Octavius of Alfred Molina.When I think that I spent my time in 2 hours and 30 min of vision, which are super long, for this terrible film, I feel sick, I wasted my time and everyone who watched it, because there isn't something new, it isn't cinema, only a product of marketing, only for sell tickets and so and so forth.Having seen this film, I'm really scared for upcoming new MCU movies, if this is the type there will be in the future I recommend Marvel to do a pleasure for itself and everyone else and close the doors and say goodbye to everyone.In conclusion, with all the hype there was for this terrible film, they could done it better, and it didn't take much in hindsight. They must not have the objective of satisfying the fans but only do something new that could be called entertainment and not repugnance in the vision, something that could not be called only fanservice but also cinema.","[['Today', 'Marvel', 'effort', 'film', 'MCU Spiderman', 'Way Home', 'the direction', 'John Watts.This', 'film', 'a mediatic phenomenon', 'a lot', 'Marvel'], ['this hype', 'cinema', 'a terrible film', 'this hype', 'something', 'everyone', 'the cinema', 'a film', 'call', 'such.The direction', 'everything', 'the computer', 'anything'], ['photography', 'cinematography', 'anything', 'a shot', 'nothing', 'mind', 'the thought', 'the money', 'a ticket', 'this total idiocy.The', 'previable', 'plot', 'a lot', 'plot', 'twist', 'anything', 'the plot', '%', 'the story', 'a total idiocy.It', 'this film', 'a real film', 'a mess', 'end', 'something'], ['The concept', 'the beginning', 'this film', 'mins.The', 'screenwriting', 'a lot', 'a question', 'mind', 'this film', 'The principal character', 'Tom Holland', 'Peter Parker/Spiderman', 'Benedict Cumberbatch', 'Doctor Strange', 'Spiderman', 'Holland', 'Spiderman', 'a dumb boy', 'sense', 'a hero'], ['an unwatchable way', 'fact', 'the other one', 'credible.In conclusion', 'acting', 'Doctor Strange', 'Benedict Cumberbatch', 'a child', 'fact', 'the symbol', 'the terrible fanservice', 'thing', 'Doctor Strange', 'the right way', ""c'mon""], ['resume', 'everything', 'word', 'an idiot.Thanks', 'this film', 'Sam Raimi', 'trilogy', 'William Dafoe', 'Goblin', 'Otto Octavius', 'Alfred Molina.When', 'time', 'min', 'vision', 'this terrible film', 'time', 'everyone', 'something', 'a product', 'marketing', 'this film', 'MCU', 'the type', 'the future', 'Marvel', 'a pleasure', 'everyone', 'conclusion', 'the hype', 'this terrible film', 'hindsight'], ['the objective', 'something', 'entertainment', 'the vision', 'something', 'fanservice', 'cinema']]","[['Today', 'Marvel', 'effort', 'film', 'MCU Spiderman', 'Way Home', 'direction of John Watts.This film', 'mediatic phenomenon', 'high expectations', 'lot of assumptions', 'Marvel fans'], ['hype', 'cinema', 'terrible film', 'hype', 'others', 'something because everyone', 'cinema', 'film', 'call', 'such.The direction', 'everything', 'computer', 'anything'], ['photography or cinematography', 'anything', 'shot', 'nothing', 'mind', 'thought', 'money', 'ticket', 'idiocy.The previable plot', 'lot of plot twist', 'anything', 'plot', '%', 'events', 'story', 'total idiocy.It', 'people', 'film', 'real film', 'ideas', 'mess for end', 'something'], ['concept', 'beginning', 'film', 'mins.The screenwriting', 'lot', 'mandatory rules', 'narrative elements', 'question in mind', 'film', 'principal character', 'Tom Holland', 'Peter Parker/Spiderman', 'Benedict Cumberbatch', 'Doctor Strange', 'ones', 'old Spiderman', 'films.Tom Holland', 'Spiderman', 'dumb boy', 'stupid ideas', 'sense', 'hero'], ['unwatchable way', 'fact', 'expressions', 'other one', 'ridicules', 'credible.In conclusion', 'acting', 'Doctor Strange', 'Benedict Cumberbatch', 'child in fact', 'behaviors', 'symbol', 'terrible fanservice', 'thing', 'Doctor Strange', 'spells', 'right way', ""c'mon""], ['resume everything', 'word', 'idiot.Thanks', 'film', 'actors', 'Sam Raimi', 'trilogy', 'such great actors', 'William Dafoe', 'Goblin', 'Otto Octavius', 'Alfred Molina.When', 'time', 'hours', 'min of vision', 'terrible film', 'time and everyone', 'something', 'product of marketing', 'sell tickets', 'film', 'MCU movies', 'type', 'future', 'Marvel', 'pleasure', 'everyone', 'doors', 'goodbye', 'conclusion', 'hype', 'terrible film', 'hindsight'], ['objective', 'fans', 'something', 'entertainment', 'vision', 'something', 'fanservice', 'cinema']]"
225,Spider-Man: No Way Home,No Way Home Run!,"LIKES:The Special Effects:
Disney's resources can be used to craft amazing pieces, and No Way Home shows just how much of the good stuff they have when they put their time and money to it. Spiderman's dive into the multiverse is beautiful on almost all fronts in both design and animation. Dazzling displays of light, color, flashing, and explosions are blended together to make exciting, comic book feeling moments, all while getting hit with darker layers as the fight progresses. Spiderman facing the various villains seen in the trailer are fantastic, as web slinging, dodging, and various blasting occurs to rock the screen with amazing, theater rumbling effects. It's a very cinema worthy movie for this alone, but there is so much more to it.The Comedy:
Disney is all about cramming the jokes into the movie to lighten things up, and sometimes they take it too far. Fortunately, No Way Home manages to keep the comedy in check, timing things at the opportune moments and hitting running gags to keep us ingrained in the MCU Spiderverse. The banter was mostly kept in check, each of the characters styles blended well together with awesome chemistry, and even better it was not too much to trip up the emotional moments this movie has, which is a fantastic balance for this reviewer.The Action:
For the most part, the fights and chases in this movie feel very much like something from the Marvel comic universe. Taking that classic Spiderman taunting, while implementing strategy, agility, and use of environment, led to some decent moments that were suspenseful and interesting to see what damage would be caused. As the movie's tone changed, the nature of the fights changed too to keep pace, and by the end it was an amazing blend of comedic, action, and emotion to paint a near perfect finale for me.The Acting:
Again, Marvel casted well in this movie and opens up so many great chemistry networks between the characters that were in this movie. Holland is still a wonderful blend of Peter Parker and Spiderman, who has taken the character again to further heights and pulls the character through the ringer. This movie puts the main character into the ringer and Holland does things so well to really grab that emotion and pull at your heart strings. Zendaya's quality still shines through, and her rendition of M. J. still holds the same core foundation, but starts to further evolve and grow the seeds planted at the end of Far From Home. Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange is top notch as usual, he's fun, he's classy, and he really sets the stage for the future of the character in this bizarre multiverse being set up and is exciting to see this transition layering more onto the character. Jacob Betalon as Ned again rocks in the comedy moment, but also extends to some other moments that were again perfect for the story. Alfred Molena, reprises the role of Doc Oc super well, bringing the same narcissism intellect of the character, but diving back into the complexity of the character we had in the second movie. There are so many more to compliment, but I can't due to potential for spoilers, but rest assure that the chemistry between this cast is a mixture of quality.Handling the Characters Well:
Spiderman: No Way Home had a lot of balls to juggle and for me, they did it quite well with the material they had to present. Extending the story from the end of the last movie, while mixing in Strange felt very natural, with adequate time spent listing out the problems and solutions the two ""Avengers"" had to find for the spell that went wrong. And once that door was opened, the complexity of the story required a lot more planning and direction. Watts and the team succeeded, managing to keep a lot of characters in the mix and making sure their inclusion was meaningful past the simple marketing for toys. Even the villains get some decent balance, again bringing their own interactions and plot components that for the most part were not forced or counteractive. It was a fantastic display of coordination and effort and given the potential disaster this could have been, I'm very much happy with the results.The Emotional Heart:
These movies and characters mean the world to the fans, and that means crossing into the heartstring pulling territory. No Way Home hits this several times, and I loved the moral testing components that they wrote in here for so many characters. Diving deeper into these characters, we got past the simple good-guy vs. Bad-guy motif and instead got something much bigger that again justified the inclusion of so many things. This is certainly one of the clutch moments of the MCU and I dare say it was something that sets so much up for the rest of the wave.DISLIKES:Pacing at the beginning:
It's all about the set up and making sure we are ready for everything to happen in the movie. As such, that was the part of the movie that I found to be a little drawn out and boring at times for me. I don't know if I was just tired, or I was hoping for a little more movement or suspense and it took about the first thirty minutes before the first fight really kicked in. Once that happened, the pacing issues were very minor at that point, only going a bit fast a few times in how some of the twists were brought in.The Computer work at times:
As much as I enjoyed the special effects and CGI, I can't say that it was flawless. No Way Home does have moments where the computer look reared its head and took shortcuts into the less realistic looking realm. The very artificial movements, the digital look to the skin, and a few other moments did drop into the lower resolution. Again, a minor flaw for me, but something I have seen in the past get fans upset.The Action at Times:
There are times where the fighting really started to ramp up, finding a great pace and stride that was gearing up for a great Spiderman brawl. However, the action would then trip and lose that momentum with an abrupt ending. There were great moments where they achieved all those incredible fighting sequences, but there were times I would have liked a little more coordination and magic that we had with other films, especially at the end with the way they were solving some problems. It feels like they were running out of time and some cuts were made to offset the full coordination, but again this is still a nitpick moment for picking on to find the answer.Some of the Bad Guys Needed A Little More:
Doc Oc as I said earlier was a fantastic villain they did so much with and Green Goblin as well has the bite that feels like an extension of the classic character. However, the Lizard and Sandman (which have been seen in the trailers), felt a little more time was needed to further expand upon their characters more and give them the same bite they held long ago. I know the reasons they were brought in for the most part, but... there still could have been some more fun with them to help get a little more mojo and time with them would have been amazing.Predictable:
I got most of the twists they were trying to surprise us with. Lots of foreshadowing handed you the keys to getting the big events that were going to happen and how they were going to help repair the mess they were looking. I can't say that the call of things being a surprise were really a surprise. However, this minor dislike still does not take away from the enjoyment of the movie for me.The VERDICT:
Spiderman No Way Home achieved a lot of greatness for this reviewer and makes me feel a little more comfortable from what is coming out of Marvel in the future. It's a fun movie that has so much to it and really brings forth an amazing experience meant for viewing in the theater. It's exciting, it's got heart, it's got comedy, and it keeps many things in the air with a balanced manner that was certainly exceeding the expectations that I had going in. No Way Home shows the multiverse may be in good hands and if they can continue this art of balance of new ideas and foundations, then we are in good hands. Sure, there are some pacing issues at time, some simplified solution finding, and a few characters needing a little more time. However, overall, this film is in the top Spiderman movies and I strongly encourage you to see it in the theater if you can find the time.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 9.0
Movie Overall: 8.0-8.5.","[['LIKES', 'Disney', 'Way Home', 'the good stuff', 'time', 'money'], ['Spiderman', 'dive', 'the multiverse', 'both design', 'animation'], ['light', 'color', 'flashing', 'exciting', 'comic book', 'feeling', 'darker', 'the fight'], ['Spiderman', 'the trailer', 'web', 'slinging', 'dodging', 'the screen', 'amazing', 'theater'], ['cinema worthy movie', 'this alone', 'Comedy', 'Disney', 'the movie'], ['Way Home', 'the comedy', 'check', 'MCU Spiderverse'], ['The banter', 'check', 'awesome chemistry', 'trip', 'this movie', 'a fantastic balance', 'this reviewer.The Action', 'part', 'this movie', 'something', 'Marvel', 'comic universe'], ['Spiderman', 'taunting', 'strategy', 'agility', 'use', 'environment'], ['the movie', 'tone', 'the nature', 'pace', 'the end', 'an amazing blend', 'comedic', 'action', 'emotion', 'a near perfect finale', 'me.The', 'Acting', 'Again', 'Marvel', 'this movie', 'many great chemistry', 'this movie'], ['Holland', 'a wonderful blend', 'Peter Parker', 'Spiderman', 'the character', 'the character', 'the ringer'], ['This movie', 'the main character', 'the ringer', 'Holland', 'that emotion', 'heart'], ['Zendaya', 'quality', 'rendition', 'M.

230,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Eh,"I hate Marvel movie and in this case I could've just lie and say I hate this movie too but no, I'm actually a little impressed of what they've done here. I love how this movie took a more playful route, the comedy is alive and although I dont think they're funny they're consistent and its giving the impression that the movie doesnt take itself very seriously. I like that better compared to their previous serious approach. Problems like plotholes and things that are just came to be are still here but it's somewhat justified because the whole plot makes no sense in the first place and so these plotholes are just a shortcut to get the characters to interact with each other and I'm honestly fine with that, its a movie where a grown man pretending to have superpowers anyway. Much of the films are nostalgia bait and much of them are effectively done. Instead of just referencing them they actually put some effort into creating something new but similar and incorporate bits from the past. Although some didn't turn well and come of as cringe like when aunt May died and she said great responsibility power thingy stuff, that was just cringe. Still the story here is the same old brain dead virtuous tripe and some actors are badly miscast, like Jamie Foxx. And there's no reason for this movie to be over 2 hours long. Anyway its a major improvement to the previous two Jon Watts' Spider-man. And I really wish they took more of this playful route and just embrace the goofiness of the superhero genre instead of trying to be all preachy and inspiring.","[['Marvel', 'movie', 'this case', 'this movie'], ['this movie', 'playful route', 'the comedy', 'the impression', 'the movie', 'doesnt'], ['previous serious approach'], ['the whole plot', 'no sense', 'the first place', 'a shortcut', 'a movie', 'a grown man'], ['nostalgia bait'], ['some effort', 'something', 'the past'], ['cringe', 'aunt', 'May', 'great responsibility', 'power', 'thingy', 'stuff', 'cringe'], ['the story', 'the same old brain', 'dead virtuous tripe', 'Jamie Foxx'], ['no reason', 'this movie'], ['a major improvement', 'Jon Watts', 'Spider-man'], ['this playful route', 'the goofiness', 'the superhero', 'genre', 'all preachy', 'inspiring']]","[['Marvel movie', 'case', 'movie'], ['movie', 'playful route', 'comedy', 'impression', 'movie doesnt'], ['previous serious approach'], ['Problems like plotholes', 'things', 'whole plot', 'sense', 'first place', 'plotholes', 'shortcut', 'characters', 'movie', 'grown man', 'superpowers'], ['films', 'nostalgia bait'], ['effort', 'something', 'incorporate bits', 'past'], ['cringe', 'aunt May', 'responsibility power thingy stuff', 'cringe'], ['story', 'same old brain', 'dead virtuous tripe', 'actors', 'Jamie Foxx'], ['reason', 'movie', 'hours'], ['major improvement', 'Jon Watts', 'Spider-man'], ['playful route', 'goofiness', 'superhero genre', 'preachy and inspiring']]"

241,Spider-Man: No Way Home,"Greatest of the Tom Holland Spiderman Franchise, By A Mile!","A certified crowd pleaser, No Way Home had me grinning from ear to ear with my finger pointed at the screen far too often. It is definitely my favorite of the Tom Holland films, and a shade under Spiderman 2 as the best one yet. To see Alfred Molina, William Dafoe and Jamie Foxx reprising their roles, was INSANE. Each of their entrances caused goosebumps and their acting, pure nostalgia! Props to Dafoe! His voice and facial expressions remains perfect for the Goblin 20 years later. Really, the reality where we see these characters together is unthinkable, yet here we have it, and the film ensures its more than fan service! Spiderman, choosing to 'cure' gives these characters a shot at the main theme of the film, redemption. This brings us to the grandest (& most spoiled) reveal in recent years, the appearance of the other Spidermen! It is difficult to comprehend and put into words the feeling of seeing Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield suit up. Filmmakers even graces its fans by showing PLENTY of these Parkers as they play huge roles in the third act, complimenting the emotional themes of the film. In fact, my favorite redemption story arch was that of Andrew's. I was blown away by how invested he was. When he caught Zendaya's MJ, his outpour of raw emotions sent shivers down my spine. It was gratifying to see the filmmakers give him justice. Another positive is we finally have a mature version of Tom Holland's Spidey. We see his mistakes and struggles to confront its consequences, themes of a grounded and relatable superhero we love and admire.All positives mentioned, the film does have shortcomings in its plot. There were moments I feel unnecessary like Aunt May's demise, Sandman's motivation and everything Ned. The premise that 'too many requests' during the spell casting ushered the multiverse crisis had a weak hold on me, and to blame it on Spiderman was a head scratcher. The film does however, a tremendous job of giving us things to love to overcome these holes. The sheer volume of iconic characters is a remarkable feat no one thought possible.Spiderman: No Way Home is then, a well packaged present as it delivers what both hardcore and casual fans want and desire. And for that, I give a score of 8.5/10.","[['A certified crowd', 'pleaser', 'Way Home', 'ear', 'finger', 'the screen'], ['favorite', 'Tom Holland', 'a shade', 'Spiderman'], ['Alfred Molina', 'William Dafoe', 'Jamie Foxx', 'INSANE'], ['acting', 'pure', 'nostalgia'], [], ['voice', 'Goblin'], ['the reality', 'the film', 'fan', 'service'], ['Spiderman', 'a shot', 'the main theme', 'the film', 'redemption'], ['the grandest', 'reveal', 'the appearance', 'Spidermen'], ['the feeling', 'Tobey Maguire', 'Andrew Garfield', 'suit'], ['PLENTY', 'the third act', 'the film'], ['fact', 'favorite redemption', 'story', 'arch', 'Andrew'], [], ['Zendaya', 'MJ', 'outpour', 'spine'], ['justice'], ['a mature version', 'Tom Holland', 'Spidey'], ['relatable superhero', 'the film', 'plot'], ['Aunt May', 'demise', 'Sandman', 'motivation', 'everything', 'Ned'], ['The premise', 'the spell', 'casting', 'the multiverse', 'crisis', 'a weak hold', 'Spiderman', 'a head', 'scratcher'], ['The film', 'a tremendous job'], ['The sheer', 'volume', 'a remarkable feat', 'no one', 'possible.Spiderman', 'Way Home', 'present', 'both hardcore', 'desire'], ['a score']]","[['crowd pleaser', 'Way Home', 'ear', 'finger', 'screen'], ['favorite', 'Tom Holland films', 'shade under Spiderman'], ['Alfred Molina', 'William Dafoe', 'Jamie Foxx', 'roles', 'INSANE'], ['entrances', 'goosebumps', 'acting', 'pure nostalgia'], ['Props'], ['voice', 'facial expressions', 'Goblin', 'years'], ['reality', 'characters', 'film', 'fan service'], ['Spiderman', 'characters', 'shot', 'main theme', 'film', 'redemption'], ['grandest', 'reveal', 'recent years', 'appearance', 'other Spidermen'], ['words', 'feeling', 'Tobey Maguire', 'Andrew Garfield suit'], ['Filmmakers', 'fans', 'PLENTY', 'Parkers', 'huge roles', 'third act', 'emotional themes', 'film'], ['fact', 'redemption story arch', 'Andrew'], [], ['Zendaya', 'MJ', 'outpour', 'raw emotions', 'shivers', 'spine'], ['filmmakers', 'justice'], ['version of Tom Holland', 'Spidey'], ['mistakes and struggles', 'consequences', 'themes', 'relatable superhero', 'positives', 'film', 'shortcomings', 'plot'], ['moments', 'Aunt May', 'demise', 'Sandman', 'motivation', 'everything Ned'], ['premise', 'many requests', 'spell casting', 'multiverse crisis', 'weak hold', 'Spiderman', 'head scratcher'], ['film', 'tremendous job', 'things', 'holes'], ['sheer volume', 'iconic characters', 'remarkable feat', 'one', 'possible.Spiderman', 'Way Home', 'present', 'hardcore', 'casual fans', 'desire'], ['score']]"

It is not surprising to find comedies in spiderman movies, but this time it was a bit too much and was rather a casual movie than a typical marvel one. Even interactions between the villains felt so trivial, this movie was clearly targeted for younger audience.I personally believe that DC movies are perhaps serious in a way which actually has a breath-taking plot, whilst spiderman has always considered more of a humorous scripts and play. I can recall that my other siblings and uncle slept back then, I was the only one left hoping that something exciting pulls off and then I can confidently wake them up, but unfortunately the movie was over before I can realise it.The movie was arguably a great execution of emotions, entertainment and climax but it could have been a blockbuster considering its potential.

249,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Didn't like it? I missed the part where that's my problem!,"Spider-man has been my all-time favorite superhero since I was a kid; to be more precise, Tobey Maguire was the only real spider-man for me and I was never able to even have the slightest interest for Andrew Garfield's spider-man. I remember wearing his suit when I was five or six years old after watching the Sam Raimi's trilogy for the 100th time and pretending that I was the friendly neighborhood spider-man. Who knows, maybe my passion for science came from these movies, cause you know, I'm something of a scientist myself. All these memories came rushing back to me after I heard the rumors about the possibility of multiverse in the new movie. I did not care if they would vitiate my good memories because of an awful storyline, all I needed was to see Tobey wearing his unique costume one more time. The moment he walked into the scene for the first time after fourteen years, the lyrics from ""No leaf clover"" by Metallica came to my mind: ""Good day to be alive Sir!"".I loved everything about the movie and I really appreciate the fact that the producers gave us another chance to see our beloved heroes and it even surpassed my expectation. Although, I would like to mention some of my opinions that I believe could make the perfect movie. The introduction of other Spider-men into the scene for the first time could have been way more exciting, however, it still did not stop the audience from expressing their huge emotions including myself. On the other hand, green goblin seemed so desperate in the first scenes before turning into the marvelous villain that we used to know. Moreover, I was expecting to see more fights between Doc Ock and Tom Holland when they met but apparently that scene was only made for the trailer to distract us from thinking about three Spider-men.Dialogues and interactions between characters were purely hilarious, not to mention the references to the old movies which have turned into memes nowadays. To be honest, I kept waiting for the moment to hear Tobey say ""I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye"", but I suppose that is never going to happen again.Right after the movie ended, I thought to myself how they can make another new MCU movie better than this one, because for me, this movie was the closest thing to an ideal movie after Sam Raimi's version. I have a feeling that spider-man (Tobey's) has shaped my personality and it has been a part of me for as long as I can remember, therefore, if I have to, I will wait another fourteen years to see him again, regardless of the story.","[['Spider-man', 'all-time favorite superhero', 'a kid', 'Tobey Maguire', 'the only real spider-man', 'interest', 'Andrew Garfield', 'spider-man'], ['suit', 'Sam Raimi', 'trilogy', 'the 100th time', 'the friendly neighborhood spider-man'], ['passion', 'science', 'cause', 'something', 'a scientist'], ['the possibility', 'multiverse', 'the new movie'], ['an awful storyline', 'Tobey', 'time'], ['The moment', 'the scene', 'the first time', 'No', 'leaf', 'clover', 'Metallica', 'mind', 'Good day', 'Sir'], ['everything', 'the movie', 'the fact', 'another chance', 'expectation'], ['the perfect movie'], ['The introduction', 'Spider-men', 'the scene', 'the first time', 'way', 'the audience'], ['the other hand', 'green goblin', 'the marvelous villain'], ['Doc Ock', 'Tom Holland', 'scene', 'the trailer'], ['the moment', 'Tobey', 'some dirt', 'eye', 'the movie', 'MCU', 'movie', 'this movie', 'thing', 'an ideal movie', 'Sam Raimi', 'version'], ['a feeling', 'Tobey', 'personality', 'a part', 'the story']]","[['Spider-man', 'all-time favorite superhero', 'kid', 'Tobey Maguire', 'only real spider-man', 'interest for Andrew Garfield', 'spider-man'], ['suit', 'years', 'Sam Raimi', 'trilogy', '100th time', 'friendly neighborhood spider-man'], ['passion for science', 'movies', 'cause', 'something', 'scientist'], ['memories', 'rumors', 'possibility of multiverse', 'new movie'], ['good memories', 'awful storyline', 'Tobey', 'time'], ['moment', 'scene', 'first time', 'fourteen years', 'lyrics', 'No leaf clover', 'Metallica', 'mind', 'Good day', 'alive Sir'], ['everything', 'movie', 'fact', 'producers', 'chance', 'heroes', 'expectation'], ['opinions', 'perfect movie'], ['introduction', 'other Spider-men', 'scene', 'first time', 'way', 'audience', 'huge emotions'], ['other hand', 'green goblin', 'first scenes', 'marvelous villain'], ['fights between Doc Ock', 'Tom Holland', 'scene', 'trailer', 'Spider-men.Dialogues', 'interactions between characters', 'references', 'old movies', 'memes'], ['moment', 'Tobey', 'dirt', 'eye', 'movie', 'MCU movie', 'movie', 'thing', 'movie after Sam Raimi', 'version'], ['feeling', 'Tobey', 'personality', 'part', 'fourteen years', 'story']]"
