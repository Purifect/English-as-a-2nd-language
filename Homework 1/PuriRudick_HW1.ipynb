    "The 3 books I used in this experiment are for 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade readers.  They are from 3 different authors, also different genes. From the result above I found that the books' vocabulary size increases with grade level; 89 for 3rd grade, 100 for 4th grade, and 123 for 5th grade. In my opinion, this is expeted as older children know more words and an read longer than younger children.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lexical diversity for each book had been analized. The exical diversity measures the number of unique words to the total size of the text. Even though vocabulary is increasing, the mix of unique words does not so the text is not confusing to the student. According to the result above, 5th grade has the higest lexical diversity score at .00045, follows by 3th grade score at .00041, and the least score is from 4th grade at .00019. It seems like even though the vocabulary size increases, the mix of unique words may or may not increase. However, the book for 5th grade still be the most complicated among the three.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this experiment, the higher age with reading level tends to have a higher vocabulary size and a higher lexical diverity."
